The only time I got bad at Chris was when I was having my contractions. That's the only time I wanted and so IV so I feel like having headphones in. Like I didn't let a player I made a turn off into selling. Now let me it. Go ahead. Go ahead, go. Just nose in. Go ahead, go. Gotta thank you for calling Blenden. This is Katen. How can I help you? Yeah, I've got kind of an unusual request. I have a tankless water heater in my house and I'm selling it, and I don't think it's really helping me get my price. So I wanted to see if it's possible to move it to my condo and put a regular water heater in the house. So I guess I need somebody to give me an estimate on that. Okay, let me see if that's something we are able to do. Is this sharing corps? Yeah, that's where the tank list is. Yeah. Give me just one moment and let me see if that scope of work is something we are able to do. Okay, thanks. Up some sort of load like it all right. Thank you so much for holding. So we actually will not work on that sort of situation. We actually won't take equipment out of the home to move it. Okay. It's not something you could do. Correct. If I take it out and put in my own water heater, are you able to install it in another location then? We cannot. It would have to be supplied through us. Okay. All right, good enough. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Okay, bye.”",Out of Service Capabilities,None

Please hold on the line and we will connect you with the next available agent. Thank you for calling Blind and Suns. This is Katen, how can I help you? I needed to schedule a check of my air conditioning. It's not cooling, it's running, but it's barely blowing into there. Okay, and have we been to the home before? Yeah, it's been a couple of years. You guys have serviced this furnace and air conditioner for years and years prior to the past few years. Got you. Okay, and what is the address? I can see if it's still in the system. Okay, and is the account name under the name of Norma? No, I'm a new. Okay, no worries. Yes. So we could get a technician out to help. We would be looking at Monday as our soonest. And to get our technician over, the diagnostic fee we have is 150, and then they would give the upfront pricing from there. Okay, that's fine. Okay, and what is the name that you would like on the account? Patricia Hunter. Okay, and then can you repeat that address one more time, please? Seven, five, eight Marie Avenue 44314. All right, and then the number that you called in from, is that the best one to call when we're on the way? Yes. Okay, and then is there an email that you would like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? Do you guys send out a bunch of other stuff? Because I am not interested in a bunch of stuff being dumped into my email, like commercials and coupons and all that kind of stuff. So if you do that no, I don't want to give you my email. Okay, yeah, that's no worries. I don't believe they sent too many, but I'll go ahead and just put not for now. And then when the technician is there, he is able to send a one time one, if you would like. All right. And on Monday, our technicians are routed on location. So I don't have an exact time as of now, but we would give a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. What are their normal hours of working? Yeah, so it would be sometime after ten. They run until around 430 at the latest. Okay, all right, I just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be later than that, because I have a commitment on Monday evenings, but earlier is fine. My day is open, otherwise. Okay. All right. And then do you know around how old the air conditioner is by any chance? It's old. I have no idea how old is, but I know that there's a sticker on the furnace and the air conditioning thing that says as back as like, I don't remember what the there is along it's old, though. But you guys have blend and sun or TriCounty has service that I'm not sure if they installed it, but I'm guessing that it's probably at least 20 years old. Got you. Okay. And due to the age of the unit, have you thought about getting an estimate to replace? I really don't want to, but I would rather see I don't know. I've not had a problem with it up until this season, so, I mean, if it's repairable, I would choose just repair. It's really not even that significant to me. I don't typically use the air conditioner. I tried to use about a week ago, like a 90 deg day, and I felt like it wasn't cooling, but I just said, forget it, turned it off and went to bed. So I'm not worried about it right now. I don't need to have it right now, but I would like to get it fixed if it's fixable. If not, then I'll think about what my next step will be. Yeah, absolutely. Sounds good. And if it is something that technician, if you do decide to go with a replacement, I do know that 150 diagnostic will go towards that. If that is something you decide to go with, would it be something I would have to do right away, or could it be, like, a couple of months down the road? Yeah, so the way that that would work, if he does recommend getting a replacement, from there, we would send what we call a comfort consultant out, and then they would give your upfront pricing from there. So if you decided to wait a few months from there, they can go over all the options once they're at the home for you. Okay, that's fine. All right, well, I have you all set then, for Monday for the service technician. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's all. Now I'm sure it probably would be a different technician, but I also wanted pricing on having a ceiling fan installed in my living room, but there would have to be wiring run and everything because I don't have a light fixture in the living room in the ceiling. So it would be like a completely new line and everything. I don't know. I would like to get an estimate on what that would cost. Got you. Okay. Yes. So the way that we work for the electricians, the service call fee for that department is 120. However, since you have another department coming out already. I could waive that if you go with their quoted repair. Okay. All right. Maybe I'll just hold off on that then, for right now. Okay. All right. It's still a whole bunch of expenses here, especially if I end up having to replace the air conditioner. I'll probably just hold off on the ceiling fan. All right, thank you. So then Monday I can expect them you yes. And we'll give you a call when we're on the way. All right. I will try to remember to leave Montana. Okay, thank you so much. All right, bye.”",New Customer - Lead Booked,None

Thank you for calling Blenden Suns, this is Holly, how can I help you? Hi Holly, I am calling to see about scheduling service and to potentially get an idea of how much it would be to schedule a service call. Okay, and what kind of service were you in need of? I believe it's going to be plumbing. Okay. Do you have a leak? Is there a drain backing up? No, we have an issue where when the cold water is running, we have fine water pressure. It's not as strong as it was before, but it's better. And as soon as the hot water kicks on, like in the shower, it's just a barely trickle. So I don't know if there's a clog in the hot water tank or there's a leak somewhere, but for some reason we've lost water pressure. Okay, sure. So to send one of our plumbers over, there is a service coffee of 120. We don't charge anything by the hour, so everything is upfront pricing. He would quote the price of the repair or the upgrade on site and then we're currently scheduling for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week. Okay, we could potentially look at Monday. How do you do scheduling? Do you do a time block or a specific time? Yes. So we only scheduled our 1st 08:00 a.m. Appointments for the day and those are booked so it would be next available. That means I wouldn't have a time, but we'd call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay, great. Why don't we go ahead and schedule that? Okay, what's your address for me, please? It is 6262 Redbird all one word terrace. And that's new. Franklin 44216. And you said red Bird. Correct. Right? Red Bird? Yes. Okay. And first and last name that you would like on the account it'll be Erica. E-R-I-C-A lynch. L-Y-N-C-H. Okay. It'll be easier for her to pay. Best phone number is 330-949-8976. Okay, and that's her cell phone? Yes. Okay, and you're at 330-347-8329? Yes, that's me. That's correct. Okay, so let me add hers. Do you have a preferred email address? Sure, it's eheath one at Kent. kent.edu, okay, let me make a note here. And you said when you use the cold water, the water pressure goes down and then in the shower it's just a trickle. Well, no, the water pressure used to be stronger within the past week, we've lost pressure. When the cold water is on, the pressure is decent, but as soon as the water heats up, the pressure decreases further towards just barely a trickle. Okay. And the water heater has been replaced within the past five years, so shouldn't need replaced. But that's what makes me think maybe there's just a clog. Okay, so I've got everything noted. I have you all set for Monday, July the third. As soon as we get a plumber freed up in that Clinton area, we'll give her that call 15 to 30 minutes in advance prior to arrival. Okay. Wonderful.

What can we do for have so I'd like to get the furnace, just the regular inspection, cleaning, tune up, whatever, and also for the air conditioner, I guess. Is there a difference between just checking them out and doing an actual tune up? Right now we are only doing air conditioning maintenance things. We don't start furnaces again until September. But when we do an AC maintenance, they will inspect the blower motor like the major components of the furnace. So they do kind of still check some areas out near the furnace, just not a full inspection. But they will do a 19 point inspection on the air conditioner and then they would just make any recommendations if needed, that we have a special for $79 right now. Okay. And then I'm also looking online, I see the HVAC free tune up on old equipment. Is that applicable for what we're doing? Um I don't know. That's a good me. Let me ask, give me 1 second. OK, yeah, sure. Thank you. Okay, Steve, so yes, we could go ahead and honor that for you right now with this visit on the air conditioner. Great. Okay, perfect. Right now I am going to be looking out at that week of the 10th. Would there be a day that week that would work for you? That week would be fine. Or weeks thereafter?

You are the next caller in the queue. You you know what you good afternoon, this is Becky. How can I help you? Yes, I was wondering if you give free estimates on new air conditionings. Hello? Yes, we do. Okay. What it is, is when I bought the house, it looked like they put a brand new furnace in, but they left the older AC unit. But the AC unit is not working now, so I would just like to get an estimate on putting a new one in. And those are free estimates? Correct. We will send a consultant out to your home. No cost, no obligation. They'll go over everything with you. We do like to allow 60 to 90 minutes. It may not take that long, but we just like to allow that much time in case you have some extra questions or anything like that, that you would need to go over with them. They'll give you all your different options, go over any financing if you need that. They can go over all of that with you when they're there. Okay, and do you know about how old the air conditioner there is? It looks pretty rough. I bought this place in 2015, and the furnace was brand new back then. The AC looked rough back when I bought it. It just stopped working last year. It's probably 15 years at least. Yeah. So I really wasn't going to replace it because I just opened my windows, but since then I had a pacemaker put in and I figured I'd better get a new so. Okay. All right, so it does not look like we've been to the home before, so I need to get an account set up for you here so we can get somebody scheduled. What is your first name? David. And the last name? David? Richmond. Richmond. And the address there? I'm sorry. There's a train going by nearest so if you hear that in the background, I do apologize. I hear a train, too. Yes. Okay. Yes. As soon as you said you heard a train, I heard the same train, maybe. Okay, and your address? Two two West State Street. And that's barbadon. Yes. Do you know where Angie's is at in yes. Yeah, we're right across the street from Angie's. Yeah, see, I don't know if that's the same train because the one I'm hearing is, like, down towards Kenmore, but I can hear it clearly, so it might not be the same train. You would think it would be, but I don't know, it just seems like that would be pretty far. Yeah. All right, David, the phone number that you're calling from, the 21633 710 twelve. That is a cell phone number. Yeah, cell phone, primary cell phone only. But it's my only number. Okay. Yeah, a lot of people, that's all they have nowadays. Okay. And do you have a day of the week or a time of day that normally works out best for you? I do have some doctors appointments scheduled, but I think it's starting like the 9th. twelveTH. I just got home today, so I got to look at that. But I think next actually, you know what, let me just get it out. I want to take my second that way we don't tomorrow, if you would like it tomorrow as well. Tomorrow? Yeah, that'd be fine. I do have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at noon in Hudson, so I should be back or early in the morning would be good. Tomorrow I have 09:00 A.m., and it only takes him like, 90 minutes. You said 60 minutes. Yeah. So he'd be out here by ten or 1030. Yeah, that should be fine. I'd be able to make it up to Hudson by then, and then I always told myself, and I'll have to see what he says, but I said whenever I have to get a new AC, I'm moving it to the back of the house. So I don't even know if that's possible just because yeah, go for that with him. When he's there, he'll be able to let you know if they can change that because I don't know how much, like the ventilating and everything. Yeah, it'd be nice to put it in the back. David, our guys are paperless. Do you have an email address that we can place on file? Yes, it's Richmond. R-I-C-H-M-O-N-D-J as in Jill, c as in Cat 41 at@gmail.com gmail.com. Okay, thank you. And David, is there going to be anybody else at the home or anybody that's involved in with, helping, making any of the decisions? We do have all the decision makers there, if at all possible. Yeah, I'm the only one that lives here. Okay. My daughter's picking me up for the appointment, so she might be here, but no, I'm the one that was here. Okay. All right, well, we've got you all set. Where did you find our phone number at? Actually, you've done some work on my neighbor's house across the street, and you've done some work, I believe, for my ex wife. I just Googled you on the Internet, but I already knew. I said your name and Googled you pretty much. I've known people that you've done work for. Perfect. Okay, so we've got you all set for tomorrow. The gentleman that's going to be meeting at the home, his name is Lee, and he will get you on right away. Okay, great. Have a great weekend. Okay.

You are the next caller in the queue. Thank you for calling Blenden Signs. This is Holly, how can I help you? I was wondering what they charged for a service call on an air conditioner. Okay. Is the unit not working properly? It's not working properly now and it hasn't been serviced recently, so I was wondering what they come for a service call and when available. Okay, so our diagnostic is 150 and then we are currently scheduling for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week. Okay. We're having some surgery here, so I'm trying to figure out what probably next week is definitely not good. The following week? Wednesday, Thursday or Friday? twelveTH. 13th or 14th, I guess what's available on one of those days? I could do any day the week of the 10th, I wouldn't have a time. We only scheduled our 1st 08:00 a.m. Appointments for the day and those are booked, but we would call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. So in other words, you really couldn't tell me a day like Thursday or Friday the 13th or 14th? I could do either one of those days, the 13th or the 14th. Okay, can you hold 1 minute while I check with my husband? Thank you. Sure, but I don't want it next week. It no hotel. How about I think that there's no appointments on the 13th. Thursday the 13th, right? I can do the 13th, I just wouldn't have a time. But we'd call 15 to 30 minutes prior to sending the technician over. How early do they do it, though? I would say potentially could be after anytime after ten or eleven and sometime before 435 30. But we always call before we send them. Call before about what, 15 minutes? Did you say 15 to 30? Yeah. Okay, so we'll set it for the 13th. Okay, what's your address, please? 6348 March in M-A-R-C-H-I-N-N drive in Ravenna. Okay, 44266 for the zip code. Correct. Okay, first and last name that you would like on the account? Douglas is the first name, last name is Hayflick. H-A-I-S. Like in Frank. L-I-C-H. Okay. And the best phone number for you. 330-618-1347. Is that a home phone or a cell phone? That's my cell phone. We don't have a home phone anymore, so it's the only phone we have. Okay, and do you have a preferred email address? I have an email address, but you would be calling, wouldn't you? Because I right. Yeah, we like to send receipts. Yeah, we like to send receipts or estimates via email. Okay. It's the same last name, Hayflick Haiflich, and then D, like for Douglas and K for karen@aol.com. Okay. So is the unit not coming on at all or is it coming on and just not cooling? It's not cooling and it just may need coolant, so I don't know. No, I think it's coming on. My husband's taking care of that. Okay. And you said you'd like the I'm sorry, did you say the 13th or the 14th? 13th Thursday. Okay. All right. Do you know how old the unit is, by chance? If not, that's all right. No, I don't. I know we're not going to purchase the new one. We just can't do that right now. Right. How long have you been in the home? It can kind of give me a base age for it. Well, we're the ones who put it in, but we've been here since 74, so we've been here 40 years. Okay, but we're the ones who put it in. Oh, no, I didn't look that up to see when I purchased it, to tell you the truth. I could look that up, but I didn't. That's all right. No worries. I'll be able to determine that when he's out there. Yeah, because we're not looking to purchase a whole new unit. We just can't do that right now. Okay, I've got everything noted, and then you are all set for Thursday, July the 13th. We'll give you that call 15 to 30 minutes in advance as soon as we are ready to send him over. Okay. All right. Anything else I can help you with? No, that's it. All right. Thank you so much.

Hi, my name is Daryl Allison, and years ago, you guys put in a furnace and AC unit for me and the AC unit, the part that sits outside is making quite a bit of noise, a lot of buzzing. Okay. I thought maybe I'd have someone come out and take a look at it. Sure. What's your address for me? Yeah, it's six five seven, talcron. That's spelled t, as in Tom A-L-K-R-O-N. Drive. All right. And it's Darryl Allison? That's correct. Thank you so much, Darryl. Yeah, so the outside condenser is making some pretty loud noise. It's buzzing pretty good. Yeah, I mean, it usually would make noise, but it seems to be a lot louder now. Pretty loud. Okay, so we can address this a couple of different ways here for you. Sure. I could set you up on a maintenance appointment, which would get us out to do a checklist, check everything out, and then make any recommendations if needed. That is a $79 visit, and I could get somebody out towards the end of next week for you. Otherwise, it would be a diagnostic appointment to get somebody out sooner, and that is $150. Okay, so it's 79 versus $150. Is that what you said? Yes. 79 versus 150, depending on how soon you are wanting somebody out. Yeah. No, I understand. Yeah, I think I would rather have someone come out sooner than later. Let's go with your second option there. Okay, not a problem, sir. I can go ahead and I could aim for today or tomorrow. What would you prefer? Either one would be good for me. Okay, I'll go ahead and add you on here for today. What we would do is as soon as we were able to get one of our guys freed up near your Akron area today, we would give you a call about 30 minutes in advance. Okay, perfect. There is a possibility at the end of the day that I have to go pick a car up, but that's probably around five or so. I just want to let you know that now rather than if you guys call me, I'm like, Darn it, I'm not home right now. No, that's fine. Thank you for letting me know that. It should be before that time, but I'll definitely make a notation just to be on the same, so I appreciate that. And real quick, Darryl, the best number to reach you is at the 330-606-3420. That's correct. Yeah. Perfect. I've got you all set. We'll be in contact as soon as we can. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. No problem. Thank you.

So what I would need is a new pullant coil, I believe is what it's called, and a new outside unit. You need a new replacement? Yeah, replacement. And it just would have to be, like, as soon as possible. I'm trying to look for the quickest job. Okay, yeah, let me get you over to the proper department and she can take a look at the schedule and let you know. So give me just a moment, please, and I'll get you transferred. Okay? Thank you. One moment, please. Thank you. Thank you. Ram Sam, this is Becky. Hi, Becky. I was calling for a same day or somewhere sooner appointment than for I'm sorry, who is this? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the person that connected me explained it. No, she didn't let me know. No, you're fine. I'm sorry. I'll explain it again. What I'm looking for is an outside unit with a new refrigerant coil, and I'm looking for the quickest appointment that I could get because I'm kind of in a time crunch. So you're just looking for an AC estimate, really? An estimate and install, if you can. Okay, well, I know I can get the estimate. I know the installs are maybe out about a week. Okay. That would depend on what it was when they came out there. What city are you in? I'm in Akron in the zip code. If I wasn't so pressed for time, I could probably get the job done myself. It's really simple. It's just replacing the outside unit, running the coil through the house, and then also replacing the refrigerator. I don't actually schedule the installs, though, so I don't know how far out they're scheduling. I know it's been about a week, but they have had some cancellations. The consultant would have to come out there and give you a free estimate, and then he would be able to find out what the install date would be. Okay. Yeah, my address is my phone number is 234-716-3172 my address is what was that again? I was trying to write it down. I couldn't quite get it that fast. Oh, sorry. My phone number is 234-716-3172 my name is Cody. My address is 1669 Green Lawn Avenue, Akron, Ohio, 4430. Okay. And there's an air conditioner there now, correct? Yes. Okay, and how old is that piece of equipment? I'm not really sure. It can came with the house. Okay. You think it's probably older than 20, say 15. Okay. And is it just not working? But the inside unit is new, so the furnace is new. Just the AC is not. Yeah. Okay. Is the AC just not working? Yeah, it's just not working. Okay. Everything else, the heating system works. Like, in the wintertime, the heating system works. It's just the outside unit, it's not working. And I would just need that replaced. Okay, let me see. I might be able to get us a consultant there here within the hour. If you can hold for 1 minute, I can check. Yeah, that'd be good. Okay. One momentum. Cody. Yes. Okay. I'm sorry for that hold. All right. I can actually get a consultant there today right around 130. He's doing some couple of things right now, but he said if he can get there sooner, he would reach out to you. And he actually knows when they can do the installs. And he said the earliest we have right now for install would be Wednesday, because we're actually close on Tuesday with the holiday. So Wednesday I would be looking for a Monday install. Like I said, nothing with you guys. The way my schedule is set up and my kids and stuff like that, I got to be in Dallas. Yeah, he could come and give you the estimate, and then he can see if anything has been canceled at that time for Monday. Okay. All right. That'd be good, too. I mean, there's no obligation for him to come out there, so you would at least have the pricing if you're getting some other estimates as well. Right. Okay, thank you so much. All right, so let me get you all set. Cody, where'd you find our phone number at today? Google. Hello, Google. All right. He'll be out there about 60 to 90 minutes. It may not take that long, but we like to allow them at least that much time. And he said again he'd be out there around 130. If he can get there any earlier, he'll reach out to you to see if you're available, and we'll get you all squared away. All right, thank you so much. All right, you're welcome. Have a good night.

I believe the total on that invoice is like 3007 something. $3,728? Yes. Okay.

And I am in the process of getting financing done. I haven't heard anything back from the application that I've done. I have all their sources right now. Oh, okay.

She said that someone would call me back yesterday to find out because the cabinets are going to be in front of that vent.

Yes, I called yesterday morning in regards of a vent in the wall, and I know you had shared that you were going to speak to a technician about what to do. Yes, I do apologize, actually. Yes, I'm glad that you called. If I send you a text message I don't know if I did send you a text message. I thought I did. I don't know if you saw it, but the tech had asked if you could send some pictures. Okay. I'm at work right now. I can contact the contractor to see if I can get some. Part of why I was calling back is because he was planning to put the cabinets up today, and so then I'll find out if he's at the house, and if so, then I'll just get some pictures. Oh, I didn't realize it was being done already. I apologize. Yeah. So the vent itself, are you guys just wanting pictures of the vent? Yeah, the wall in the vent area so that he knows the area that you're speaking of. Okay. Because I'm looking through my pictures, and I think I have a picture of that. Yeah, because he can't put up the cabinets until we find out what to do. Okay. I just sent you a text message, so whenever you have a moment to send those over, if you want to, go right ahead, and I'll work on getting them over to the service manager. Okay. All right, I will definitely do that. I'll contact the contractor to see if he can send me some pictures. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.

This is Heidi. Good morning, ma'am. I was wondering about how to set up paying for an estimate that I was given as well as how to work out the financing. Okay, you want to do financing for it or are you wanting to pay for it? Yeah, I wanted to finance it specifically. I tried to fill out the thing online a few days ago where you go to the secondary website and you fill out that for financing. But I haven't seen or received anything from that since, so I figured I'd try to ask, see if I can figure it out. Okay, so you did already go online and fill out an application? Yes, ma'am, through our website. Okay, so let's start there. Give me 1 second. Let me get into the website and see where we're at with that. Bear with me one moment. Of course my computer is going to run slow. That's always how it works. It is. Oh, my goodness. All right, there we go. Okay, so let's see here. What is your first and last name, sir? My first and last name is Scott Fletcher. Okay, so it was approved and we are just waiting for you to sign the loan documents. So those would have been emailed to you at whatever email address that you entered. When you filled out the documentation, make sure you check your spam, because sometimes they do go to spam if they're an unknown user. So do that and then we are good to go. Sure. Okay. Yeah, I'm not seeing it in my email or my spam, which is strange because normally I get a text message when stuff comes up. Is there any way to see what email is on there? We don't see it because you would have went through and done that with the actual loan company, so we don't see what information that you enter. So unfortunately, no, I cannot see. I could resend it that way. If something happened, I could go ahead and resend it. That way you can keep an eye out for again, we've had that happen and it does come through the second time. Do you want us to go ahead and do that? Yeah, if you don't mind. Okay. Yeah, we'll get that taken care of. I'll get it taken care of as soon as we hang up. And if you don't see it by this afternoon, give us a call back. Awesome. Thank you so much. You're welcome, sir. You have a good one. You too. Thank you.”",Other,None

Yeah, my name is Susan carrier, and I purchased a generac generator from you guys about a year and a half ago, and it's got a red light on it, which I don't know what that means.

I know that that maintenance is typically yearly, so I'm not sure I don't believe that would be what it would need, but to get the electrician over, we would label that. Give me just 1 second, please. Okay, yes. So to get the electrician over, the service call fee would be 120. However, if it is anything warranty related from there, they would waive that once they're at the home and diagnose what's going on with the unit. Okay, that's fine. When can they come out?

So I'm just curious because my fiance didn't give me an estimated time and so he's already heard me blow up his phone because this is my day off and I could have slept the freak in. And I'm not saying that I'm not grateful for getting an air conditioning unit today, but to have a time frame would have been freaking nice. Let me see here. I mean we're already grumpy from having no AC the last few days in this house, reaching excessive temps, so I was really hoping that they would get here early. When it's going to be 88 slipping degrees in here? Let me look to see what time frame we got. Is this for 628 25th street? Oh, it sure is. Maybe it was my mistake just assuming they'd be here early, but I only have two days off a week, thursdays and Sundays. Today would have been really nice to sleep in. And I could have, but I didn't know. Okay, look, I'm looking to see when they would be there. 1 second. I apologize. So I'm trying not to be ungrateful because I really am grateful for getting an AC unit installed today. However, I'm not grateful that I was up at the ass crack of dawn on my day off. Right, I totally understand that. So it looks like you are their second job of the day and it's in a time frame between twelve and five. That's awesome. During the heat of the flipping day at least they are their next job. They're just currently doing an install. No, and I understand that it's going to take a while, which is why I'm saying I was hoping with all praying to God that I wouldn't have to endure another 83 plus fucking degrees in my house. Right, I totally understand. Yeah. So you will be their next job. So as soon as they wrap up from this one they would give you a call and head that way. But it's between the twelve to five time frame it looks like. So what number do they have to give a call? Because between me and Rick, rick's at work today. I'm home. They need to call me because I'm going to run and go get bread and some drinks so that I'm not freaking dying because they're on the back of my neck. So do you want us to call the 861-2662 number? Is that your number? That is my number. Okay, perfect. Well then I will go ahead and note to give you a call whenever they're heading that way. All right. Go grab said cold drinks to lay on my body and prepare for hot temperatures again. I know. I apologize. But they will be there soon for you, okay? Yeah, just not soon enough.

No, it was on. It just wasn't cooling. The temperature wasn't reaching what we were asking for. It was about four or five degrees hotter than what we were asking for. Okay. And then do you know how old the unit is, by chance? Actually, I don't. I bought the house a couple of years ago, or we're not even been there two years. Okay. I just had the PM done on it, like, three or four weeks ago by Arco. Okay. But I have a call into them too, but I haven't heard back from them. Gotcha. So we currently are scheduling tomorrow or any day next week, and then to send our technician over. There is a diagnostic about does that go against anything the issue, or is that just straight up fee? That is the fee, yeah. Anything that needs to be repaired or upgraded would be on top of that. Yeah. Okay, and you say it's correct, and you're saying that you can give me a time for tomorrow? I wouldn't have a time. We only schedule their first adm appointments for the day, and those are booked. We would call them minutes prior to arrival. Yeah, let me call Arco. Since they did the PM, let me see what they have come up with, if anything. Okay, I'll call you back. Okay, sure. Thank you. All right, thanks. Bye.

I got an air conditioner and it cools the house a little bit, but it cuts on and off. Okay. Do you know how old the unit is, by chance? It's probably about maybe I've been living here for about 25 years. About 25 years old? No, it's about maybe 20 years. Okay.

Are you available today or tomorrow? Yeah. Okay. Tomorrow probably better, though. Okay. Now, I wouldn't have an exact time for tomorrow, but we would call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay. So I thought they had, like, a $69 inspection thing where they clean out your air conditioner, because it ain't really nothing that's bad, and for that kind of money that you're talking about, I might have to go somewhere else. Yeah. And that's for a tune up on a system that's running properly. That's a tune up on a system that is running properly. With it not cycling correctly. We would have to schedule for a technician to come out and run a diagnostic. But guess what? If a system is running properly, would you need a diagnostic if it's running properly? I don't think nobody would call and say that they want you to check out the air conditioning if it's running properly, but if it's not cycling correctly, that means it's not running properly. Okay, yeah, but I'm just saying mass is not cycling properly. Right? So it would have to be a diagnostic for 150, not a tune up. Okay, so why would you ask for a tune up? Well, you mentioned the coupon. That's for a tune up, we can't apply that because the system is not running properly. Okay, well, I might call you back, but I'm going to check a few other places. Okay, sure, not a problem. Thank you for calling. All right, bye bye. Yes, daddy told.”",New Customer - Lead Booked,Price Shopper

This is Ellie, how can I help you? Hi there, Ellie. I had a couple questions for you about my existing equipment and a recent service visit. Okay. Is this for Peterborough Drive and Stowe? Yes, it is. Okay. All right. It looks like we were just out there for you today. Oh, or he's out there now for you. Okay. All right. What kind of questions can I help answer? Well, my first question is when did you install my air conditioning unit? All right, we installed it. I'm showing a date of May 5. And when did you install my furnace? Furnace was installed. There we go. All right. The furnace was installed sorry about that. There we go. Furnace was installed on February. Okay. How long have we been customers of Blend? Can you tell that? Let's see here. Looks like at this home. Okay, so we had service last month, well, I guess it would now be two months ago. April 18, I think, with our standard yearly furnace and AC. Okay, I do see that. Tuesday, April 18. Yes. Okay. And the result of that is that all of our systems were good working order, nothing needed. Obviously. I just called because our AC is in fact not blowing cold air. Didn't know what it was. Right. Like maybe something was changed. Whatever. Hence why we have somebody out there today. The result of today's visit is of dollars. And I'm trying understand that and two kind of go, what happened on April 18 and what did I pay for? I see. Okay. All right, let's take a peek here. I do see on the 18th we did the tune ups on both the furnace and the air conditioner. And the results? Yeah. Everything was operating. Yes. Found no operational issues at this time. He did recommend just having the blower wheel removed and cleaned and having both of the coils chemically washed, but otherwise no. He did say everything was functioning. Correct. It clearly is not functioning. And now, today, I don't know if he's put his estimates or work orders in, but everything that has been communicated of dollars. And my air conditioner, I'm not getting it. I need some help to understand. I asked those questions to begin with because we have been loyal, faithful customers of Lyndon Sons and to have a service a month and a half ago and have everything be fine and now we're of dollars. I don't understand it. I'm highly agitated and clearly it is not your fault. So please do not I am not jumping on you, but I most definitely need to understand why I'm in this position and what the heck I paid for in April. Okay, let me take a look here. You have some estimates? I'm just trying to read the notes. Okay. It looks like he's found the unit low on refrigerant. Okay. So it's not cooling properly and it's freezing up. Let's see what else he's got here. I do apologize. My system is just a little laggy this morning. No. And again, while my voice is very agitated right. Like I am totally willing to be patient and I appreciate you helping me. Oh, no, absolutely. I appreciate that. Thank you. Let's see what we can learn here. There we go. Okay. All right, so I do see that today's visit is a courtesy call to come out and see what was going on with the unit. It does look like it is low on refrigerant. He doesn't say what caused that. Oh, I'm sorry. He does. He said it could be due to a small leak and then he had options to perform a major leak search, repair, refill, or to try the easy seal. Looks like is what he's looking at today. Let's see. Okay. Yeah. Other than those estimates, I don't show any notes on the file from today's visit yet. Just those couple of estimates he wrote up. So I'm not sure what the cause of the leak is, but yeah, at this point oh, goodness. I know he had just done the maintenance thing for you and everything looked good back in April. Yeah. And it had refrigerant and that was a very OD it was a whole, like hey, if it was on your colder wouldn't be able to do this. You can't add refrigerant when it's too cold. There was a whole thing when he was out last time. Okay. Yeah. I'm not certain. Have you just started using it again since the maintenance or had you used it prior? We have not. Okay, so again it's working. And now all of a sudden again you're not talking. Hey right. Oh, we just got to do this or we just got to do that. We got a clean bill of health April 18 with no actual things that were said that needed to be done, that we even said, hey, let's defer that we were in good shape. And now what? He is telling my husband I am in route home right now. He is quoting of dollars on this air conditioning unit which we have had faithfully serviced by Blinden songs. Yeah, I see that. It looks like he wants to repair the refrigerant line, add coolant and then perform that leak search. Let me see. There's another one here. Otherwise yeah, he's suggesting the easy seal, but that one does not have a guarantee that it would work depending on the size of the hole, wherever it is in the system. And then, yeah, I do see another one. Just to add the coolant itself. Yes. I'm not sure he doesn't say what happened here, whether it's a large or small leak. It doesn't look like he knows that yet until he does the leak search. Yeah, but unfortunately, sometimes things just happen. I don't know what would have caused this. Until he has any more additional notes in the file here, I only show those estimates. I do apologize. Well, I am confident that you are understanding how I'm feeling right now. And percent. I am questioning what I paid for back in April. Percent. Okay. No, I understand. And again, we do this yearly. And let's just be honest here. You guys install the new furnace. You guys messed up my install on a brand new furnace. And now every year, in order for it to be covered, I have to get yearly maintenance in order for you guys to honor your work on my new furnace. So this is two things, and from a customer standpoint, there's a threshold of feeling like the job is not being done when the people into my home. And I am a loyal customer and I happen to work in the property management business and right, like, I get it. But I am percent questioning what work was done and the quality of work that was done. And that is not something that I am accustomed to questioning with your company. Okay. No, I understand. Other than just doing that routine maintenance, it looks like that's all that was done at that visit. No additional work. He did say everything was in operational order and he only recommended those little cleanings to be done. Otherwise, I have the inspection report here that I could share out with you. I don't know if that would be of any help, but I do show both the AC and the furnace inspection reports from that visit in April. Well, it would be helpful because, again, now I'm faced with what was done. Right? Do I have to seek other consultation? I entrusted Blinden funds. I feel deceived. We have never deferred maintenance. You can go back to the whole history. In fact, you can go back to our house prior to this one when we had blinden's son. What I can do is, if you don't mind, I can place you on a brief hold and see how we can mitigate this here for you. That would be great. Okay. One moment, please. Thank you. Thank you.

My wife and I just recently moved into a house in North Canton about a month, month and a half ago. And over the last couple of weeks, we just noticed that the power flickers pretty severely in our house at times, and we just wanted to see maybe we need to make them out and look at our fuse box or try to assess what the issue could be. If we turn the microwave on, it'll start to cook. It'll turn off, turn back on, turn off, turn back on. The washer was doing the same thing the other day. We know there's a drain. Sometimes when the air conditioner comes on, the whole house will kind of dim and go back up, which we know is kind of normal, but it's probably that percent range. But even when the air conditioner is off, like I said, we turn the microwave on, it turns off, starts, turns off, and we just want to get it looked at. Got you. Okay, sure. What is the address for me, please? S. Thornham. T-H-O-R-N-H-A-M. Circle northwest. North Canton. Okay, so it's south, and then it was Thor, and then it was H. What was the rest of it? Thornham. Thornhamham. Okay. And it looks like we've never been to the home before, is that correct? Not that I have. So we've only lived here a month and a half. Oh, got you. Okay, so we do have availability today, tomorrow, or any day next week to send our electrician over. There is a service call fee. We don't charge anything by the hour, so everything is just upfront pricing. Is there a day that works best for you? I mean, if they could come today, that'd be great. It just seems like it's been getting the worst the last couple of days before anything happens. We just want to be safe. Sure. Yes, absolutely. Now, I wouldn't have a time, but we would call minutes prior to arrival. And what city are you in? North Canton. And zip code is? Yes. Okay. First and last name that you would like on the account, please? Steve. S-T-E-V-E there. Sayr. Okay. And the best phone number for you. Okay. And your preferred email address? It's going to be my last name. sayre@gmail.com okay. Perfect. Okay. All right. I will get everything noted, Steve, get you on for today. As soon as we have an electrician free up in that North Canton area, we'll give you that call minutes prior to arrival. All right, perfect. Thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. Thank you.

Thank you for choosing us today. We value your business. Thank you for calling Blind and sun. This is Katen, how can I help you? Yes, I have a central air unit that is short cycling, and I just wanted to see what a service call and a diagnostic would run. Okay. Roughly. Have we been to your home before? No. Okay, so our diagnostic fee for a unit not working is $150. And then they would give the pricing from there once they are at the home for the repair. Okay, so that's the service fee for the call and then it's whatever is going on past that. Correct. Is that for the initial diagnostic as well or is there an additional charge for that? Yeah, so the 150 gets our technician to the home to diagnose the unit and then give the repair price from there. So there's not an additional charge to diagnose or there is no, it is included in that 150. Okay. And what is the soonest availability you have? Yeah, we are looking at tomorrow is our soonest or any day next week. Okay. Does someone have to be at the home? Yes, we do like it if they are. We do require payment at time of service, so it does make it a little more convenient. Do you have a specific time for tomorrow? I've got several appointments that I need to be at. Got you. Okay. Yeah, so for tomorrow, they are routed on location with the amount of emergency calls we have had come in this week. So it would just be sometime after ten. But we would give a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. Okay. I'll tell you what, is there any way you could schedule for Monday? Because I can't guarantee I can be there tomorrow. Yeah, absolutely. And on Monday it would be that same thing that sometime after ten arrival and we would give that call when we're on the way. Sounds good. Okay, and what is the name that you'd like on the account? Tim Van Nostrin. Two words. V-A-N. Space capital N-O-S-T-R-A-N. All right. And what is the address? Four. Three, two hartman Road. H-A-R-T-M-A-N. That's wadsworth 44281. All right. And the number that you called in from, is that the best one to call when we're on the way? Yes. 330-730-5244. Okay. And then last thing is they are paperless in the field. Do you have an email that you'd like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? Sure. That's Tim at densevanish. That's d as in David entsvanish.com. Okay, perfect. I went ahead and got that account added for you, and you said that the air conditioning is short cycling. Is it just coming on and coming right back off? Yeah, exactly. It's just doing it repeatedly. And it will not let the compressor cycle or cool, though. I check the basic things like the filter, and I even bypass the thermostat red and yellow wires to see if I can manually jump it. And it does the same thing. So I'm thinking it's either maybe the refrigerant levels are low or maybe it's a relay something in the transformer. Got you. Okay, absolutely. Well, I can go ahead and the last thing is, do you know around how old the unit is, by any chance? I actually don't. We moved in about a year, almost two years ago. And I was told by the inspector that I believe it's a ream unit. It's a pretty big one. It looks a few years old, but it doesn't look that old. Maybe within the last five years. I could be wrong, but it looks like it's in pretty good condition. Got you. Okay, absolutely. I will go ahead and get all that noted for you and we will give you that call on Monday. Sounds good.

Okay, so for that, since the unit is not blowing as cold as the air as it normally does, we wouldn't be able to do the maintenance, but we are able to run a diagnostic and our diagnostic fee is okay. And then they would give the pricing for any repair from there once they are at the home. Okay, and how soon could they come out? Yeah, we are looking at tomorrow as our soonest. Okay, that'd be great. Okay, and the number that you called in from, is that the best one to call when we're on the way tomorrow? It sure is. Okay, and then I do have another number on file.

We value your business and welcome the opportunity to assist you with your heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical and duct cleaning. Thank you for calling Blenden Suns. This is Ellie. How can I help you, Ellie? I have a question for you. We are former customers. I've got a question about a perfect air fresh air exchanger. We had your company put in back in our house in Green, and we moved. It was taken out. We brought it with us, thinking we would use it somewhere else that we moved to, and we never did. And we live in Medina, in Montville Township now, and we're cleaning stuff out of our house. And we've got this in a corner. And we're wondering if this thing is even a useful item anymore that somebody might want or that would even be usable if we were to find out we had radon in our house. Or if it's something that is so outdated that the new technology would be far better in removing radar radon. But it was called a Perfect Air Fresh Air Exchanger. And Blind and Suns put it in and I don't even know if they make those anymore. I don't even know if they have parts to service those anymore. Okay. Yeah, I'm not, um in my time here, I've not heard of this, but it doesn't mean anything. I've only been here about two years, so let's see here. Yeah, it's to mitigate for radon is what it is when people have radon in their basements. What it did is it pulled the air, like the inside air and sent it out, brought fresh air to the inside. And that way it just kept circulating the air in the house. Because we found out we had radon when we lived in Green, and that's why we had them put it in. And when we moved, we thought, well, gee, we know radon is pretty common. We'll just take it with us. We may need it. Well, the house we ended up buying had a crawl space, so we didn't need it. And then we moved. And you know how you forget things? You just got it stored and you don't. But if it's no good, there's no point in me even keeping it. But it's called Perfect Air, and I've got a model number or whatever its US. Patent number was, but it was a model perfect Air Fresh Air Exchanger. Okay, let me see if I can get an answer or find out who could give me an answer. Can I place you on a brief hold? Sure, yeah, that's fine. Thank you so much. One moment. Okay, sure.

Thank you for holding. Are you still there? I'm here. Thank you. All right, so I learned that we do have different options now. Like fresh air intakes. They call them an ERV now. I don't know if it would be exceedingly more efficient than the unit that was installed. I just did a quick search online. It does look like they still make those. Yeah. My husband I was talking to you, he heard me and he was upstairs and he told me they still make them. So we're thinking worth us just getting it installed in our basement to exchange our air now. Yeah, that's definitely an option. Yeah, it does look like they still make those. And it looks like if it still works okay. It might still be beneficial for you, especially if you do experience Radon and Medina there, right? That's true. Yeah. We're down here removing stuff to go out to the landfill. I think we're going to be making an appointment to this thing installed. Well, okay. I really appreciate your information. Yeah, absolutely. Is there anything else that I can help with?

Thank you for calling Blind and Suns. This is Caitlin. How can I help you? Hi, Caitlin. I talked to you on Saturday about a seal from the tank to the toilet. Yes. And I wanted to let you guys know that I got that seal replaced so they don't need to come out for that. I went to a hardware store and I took the old seal and I replaced it so it's not leaking when we flush it. Got you. Okay. Yes, I do know I was still waiting to hear back from that technician since he was out in the field today, but I am so glad that you got that figured out. Yeah, I think whenever we're waiting on insurance, come back and see what they're going to do. I think they might even be calling because we gave them your number for contact, because Blending Sun is who we want to do the plumbing and the toilet. I'm going to probably change the toilet. I don't imagine it's covered. So I'll have to get a separate estimate for a couple of other things that I want done while they're tearing up all the piping and plumbing. Would that be possible when they come out? Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem at all. And then while I actually have you on the phone, I believe I was one that actually spoke to your insurance earlier, and we had spoke to the Mrs. But we do need just verbal permission so that when they do call, we can give them information. Yes, you can. Okay, sounds good. I was actually waiting for one of you to call, so that's perfect. And I can go ahead and get the account noted. That way, when they do call back tomorrow, we can give them the information that they need. Yeah, give them whatever information. And I don't know if the technician that was here took pictures. I know my wife took pictures and stuff like that, but yeah, give them the information so we can start moving forward and seeing what we can do and stuff. Because it's really not much fun taking a shower because what I have to do is I have to put a stop in the bathtub, get my shower, then take a shot back and suck all the water out. Got you. Absolutely. We definitely want to get this handled as soon as possible. So I did note the account for you that when they do call back in tomorrow, she had told me she was going to try again tomorrow. So we have their permission. Yes, and if you can't get a hold of me, you should have my wife's number. 303-27-0592. Yes, I do show that here. Okay. Because where I work at and I work from 830 to five, I cannot get cell phone coverage inside. And even if I get a voicemail, it takes a few hours to show up unless I go outside. So any questions or anything else, you have my permission to speak with my wife Helen, and everything else, because actually, she was here when Dave was here. She actually knows more about than I do with what Dave said. Okay. Caitlin. Gotcha. Okay. Sounds all right. Thank you so much. You have a great evening. Yeah, I didn't want the guy to come down and say, well, because I know that you guys go all over, so I didn't want him to drive all the way down here for something that's fixed. Yeah, absolutely.

R-I-C-H-M-O-N-D. Okay, and what is the address, please? It's going to be four four three Orchard Grove Avenue, and that'll be in Northfield. Zip code is four 40 67. Okay. And the number that you're calling in from, is that the best one to call when we're on the way? Yeah, that's definitely the best one. Okay. And the last thing is they are paperless in the field. Do you have an email that you would like to keep on file. Yeah, best email address. It's just my first and last name. Kylerichmond. 131-3169@yahoo.com. Okay, sounds good. And we have availability for an electrician. We would be looking at Wednesday as our soonest, if that would work. Yeah, Wednesday would be fine. Okay. And on Wednesday they are routed on location. So I would have an arrival sometime after ten, but we would give a call when they're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand, and that's perfectly fine. I work from home, so I'll be home either way. Okay, sounds good. Well, I have you all set then for Wednesday, and we will see you then. Awesome. And there was one other thing that I essentially need done. Doesn't have to be the same visit, but if they could do both, it'd be awesome. The other thing is it was kind of an outdated house. We put in a new refrigerator that has one of the little water dispensers, but there is not a water line that runs to the refrigerator area. I have the cable for it and everything, but I don't know if I need specifically a plumber to install that or if it's something I assume probably not the electrician's thing, but if he can, that'd be cool. Yeah, absolutely. So it would be a plumber we would send. Okay, so the plumber, we have the same service call of the 120. And then I have a coupon that I can apply to both for you since you're having more than one service on. So if you go with either of theirs, I can cut that in half if you go with the quoted work. Yeah, no, absolutely. I'll definitely do that. Okay. And did you want to get them both out on Wednesday then? Yeah, they could both be there Wednesday. That makes it easier there. Okay, sounds good. Well, I have you all set then for the plumber and electrician on Wednesday, and then we will give a call when they're both on the way. Sounds perfect. Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you. Have a good one. Thank you very much. You as well. Thanks. Bye.",New Customer - Lead Booked,None

I rent my house, but my landlord and myself had Blind and Sons out to my house probably about a month ago now, and they gave us a whole new air conditioning. He bought an air conditioning. They installed it and everything. I have water on the floor of my furnace room, and my landlord is currently out of town, but he sent his son over, and we have assessed that it seems to be coming from a piece of hosing that they installed when they installed the new air conditioning. Has his son going to get some putty to just try to temporarily seal the hole? But my landlord's instructions to me was call Blinden Sons and get them back out of there to fix the problem. Got you. Is this for the 1589 Robin Lane? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so I do apologize. Even if it is a warranty issue, we still do have to get approval from the landlord, so he would have to call in and make the appointment. He told me to call because he's out of town. He's driving right now in New York City, rush hour traffic, and he will need not be the one to be here. I am the one who has to be home. So you can get approval from him to come see me, but it has to jive with my schedule. Yes, and that shouldn't be a problem. We do just have to speak to him and get the approval to make the appointment. Okay, so if he's unavailable right now, you're saying you won't even come tomorrow? I have water in my basement. We do have to get approval. I could try to reach out to him if that would she the wife is the one relaying the messages because he's driving in heavy, heavy New York City traffic. So you could probably talk to his wife, but I don't know that you'll be able to talk to him. He was not even able to lay messages. Yeah, as long as it would be one of the owners of the home or his wife. Is just one of them would have to talk to. Okay, let me give you the wife's number, because it's probably not what you have on file since you have his information. I know you do stuff at their house, too. He's told me. But the wife's name is Debbie, and the landlord is Mike. I mean, they're kind of both my landlords, but he's the one in charge of everything. The last name is O Apostrophe. D-O-N-N-E-L-L O'Donnell. And the wife's phone number 305-64-7100. Okay, sounds good. I will reach out to her, and then I will give you a call back as soon as I hear from her. Like tonight.

You are the next caller in the queue. Thank you for calling Blend and Suns. This is Ellie, how can I help you? Oh, yes. Hi, Allie. I just called a few minutes ago about problems with our HWAC. And so they told me that in order to continue with that ten years warranty, I have to have a maintenance plan. It's a residential HWAC. Is that right? Is this for Fairmont Boulevard? Yes. Okay, so let me see here. Okay, I'm taking a look here. So I don't believe that you would need to have the maintenance program. You just need to have the yearly maintenance thing done on the unit. Now, the maintenance program does include that service, and it also offers discounts across all of our departments. Okay, yeah, probably that's what they meant. How much do you guys charge for, like, a yearly maintenance to get to come over? So the regular price for a yearly maintenance is 129 per piece of equipment. I do have a special running right now for $89. And then the maintenance plan for one system home is 198 for the year or 1650 a month. So the thing is, the air conditioner doesn't work. So that's why I called. So it's only two years old, and it's kind of very frustrating. It was working a few days ago, and now I just checked the temperature 72. That's what's coming out of the vents. So I don't think it's correct. And I look at the compressor, both pipes that coming out, they like approximately the same temperature, so I just felt them. So I guess we do need someone to come over. And I talked to previous person, and they say that you guys have someone to come over tomorrow and see. Yes, I can work to get someone out for you as early as tomorrow. I wouldn't have a set time, but they would give a call on the way about 15 to 30 minutes in advance. Okay. Yeah, that should work. Okay. Now, I'm sorry, the regular diagnostic charge to get them out there and run the diagnostic on the unit is $150. If you were to go with that maintenance program, it would bring that diagnostic charge to $60. And then you also get 15% off any work they do at the home. Okay. Now, if the reason why it's not cooling, and I hope it would be under warranty, am I still responsible for any payments? So, no. If it is something covered under that blend warranty, they would waive that diagnostic for you. Okay, I'm just kind of like extrapolating here. If the coolant, if the agent is gone, obviously it happened without our involvement, that should cover the warranty, right? I'm not going to say, oh, that's how it is now, I'm just curious. Sure. You're saying if the coolant has leaked out of the system, right? I think it would depend on the cause, but I know that typically, refrigerant is not included. Now, if there is some underlying cause that would be different, then he would have to come out and diagnose what's going on. Okay, well, how about this? Let's get the guy. Can he come over, and once he tells us what it is, we can make a decision on signing up for this maintenance plan or that would be too late. No, if you want to sign up for that maintenance plan with the technician, you can do that at time of service. Okay. As soon as we sign up, then the price will change, obviously. Right? Yeah, it would change it okay. Yeah, I think that will make sense. Okay. Yeah. So I can get someone out for you tomorrow. That's Tuesday, August 1. Is this the best number to reach you when we're on our way? The 216548 number? Yeah, 216-548-9523. And if you don't mind, can you also add another number? It's the same one, except it ends on two six instead of 2326. Yeah. Okay, I'm at work tomorrow. Yeah. Her name is Natalie. Okay. Natalie. All right, well, we can give Natalie a call when we're on the way. Yep. Okay, perfect. That sounds good. I got that noted. Then we'll give her a call when we're on our way tomorrow, and I will come out and see what's going on with that unit. It okay. Sounds good. Please send us a nice guy. Yeah, absolutely. They're all nice. Yeah, we'll send out. Okay. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thank you so much. You too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.""",Existing Customer - Lead Booked,None

I just measured the temperature. It's like coming in is like coming out. I'm not sure how accurate my measurements are, but I was wondering if you could check if we are still under warranty and how much you guys charging to coming over and check things out. Okay, and you said it's coming on but not cooling to the temperature that you have set on the thermostat. Right, but it's stuck in ears. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it feels warm too. The compressor is working. Everything is working. All right, sure. What's your address for me, please? Fairmont Boulevard in Beachfield, Ohio. I got a phone number for you. Yes. All right, and then still no email address? There was one. Okay. All right. Now I see that you used to have a maintenance plan that expired with us back on September 30 of last year. Would you like to renew that for the get those tune ups and percent off all the service call fees and then any work we do, you would get a percent discount. And then the last time we did the maintenance was last year. So, yes, as long as we have to do maintenance though this year, then you have to do the maintenances every year to keep that your parts and labor warranty valid. Okay. And you say how much is that? Two years a year. So that maintenance plan covers you for a year and then it includes the maintenance on the AC, the furnace priority service, half off of all of our service call charges. And then any work we do, you get an additional percent discount. Okay. And you said if I don't have that maintenance plan, my manufacturer warranty is not going to be valid either. Yeah, you would have to do maintenances every year on the system to keep that parts and labor warranty valid. Oh, boy. And I was going to ask you something else. So for example, if I renew this, you guys going to come over and take a look at things? So is the repair going to be covered by warranty or how does it work? So if you get back on the plan, it would be dollars to send the technician over to run the diagnostic. If you don't, it would be he would then determine if the repair the upgrade is covered under that your parts and labor warranty. And then if it is, then the service call or the diagnostic would not be charged. But they have all the warranty information with them on their trucks. Okay, I see. And how quickly do you think this technician can come over here? We've got availability tomorrow or the rest of this week. I just wouldn't have an exact time, but we'd call minutes prior to arrival. Okay. Can I think this for a few minutes and give you a call back? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And you guys open seven. Okay. All right. I'll give you a buz in a few minutes now. Okay. Okay. All right.

Is there any problem with us not being here, or is it just as simple as someone needs to be here to let him in? Right, yeah, just to let him in. And then it looks like the tech does need to collect the balance. Okay. Is there an estimate for I work right down the street. Is it possible that when he is done, he could give me a call and then I can literally just pop home real quick and pay, and then I can be back to work? Okay. Or yeah, you could do that and I can note that. Or we could just put the card on file and then obviously, we wouldn't use it until he called you anyways to let you know that the job is complete. Okay, but if that's easier for you to zip home from work, I mean, whatever is easiest for you. Brennan. Yeah, I think it'd be easiest for me to just zip like I live work five minutes down the street.

Yeah, so we could schedule for the electrician to come out and run the lines and with the heaters do you mean install the heaters themselves? Well, they're going to have to run a gas line out to the heater plumbed in okay, but I have no okay, yeah, plumber could come out and quote running the gas line and then the electrician can come out to run that line and quote that. But do you have somebody else to install the heaters themselves? Because we will do all of it but install the heaters. It's already installed. I just need the gas then.

I think back in early June I had one of your plumbers come out and give me an estimate for capping off my irrigation system, and I would like to get that work scheduled, please. Gotcha. Okay. Yes. Okay. And you said you were looking to proceed with one of the estimates that we gave, right, yeah, I'm trying to find it in my email here. That was not it's. All right. Why can't I find the estimate here's? Oh, my gosh. Think the appointment was June 16, and I think he gave me the estimate. I think it was the next day. I'm not finding the estimate in my email though, at the moment. Got you. Okay. Yeah, that's no worries. So was it in regards to plumbing then, or the service technician being there? It was the plumbing. Plumbing, okay, right. Yeah. So he came out, it was actually the secondary look at the irrigation system and what need to do to get that capped off. Got you. Okay. Yeah. Let me go ahead and look here. I show an estimate. He said this one was who shut the main water in the house, cut off the tea, and then feed the irrigation system, a couple of section of pipes back into place. I showed that was correct. Yeah, that's the one I believe. Okay, and then let me double check, just make sure because I show there's one other estimate here. I just want to make sure we go with the right one here. Yeah, and then I showed the second one was to shut off the water to the home, the same thing with the irrigation system, and then install a cap on that line, turn the water back on, check for leaks, and then that would get him there and then he would order the materials from there, it sounds like. So that one was yeah, the cheaper one was, I think ordering getting it ordered in advance. The other one was like turning it around, like the same day he was going to go get it or something like that. Yes. I do show that it looks like was the fee to perform the work today as well, correct? Right. Yeah. So definitely want to do the version of that. Okay, yeah, sounds good. So the way that we work, for any follow up, we would have to collect half down and then if he does need to order any parts from there. He would. I do show here. It may not need ordered, but if no parts are needed, then we would give you a call back to get you right back on the schedule. Okay. All right. And let's go ahead and get to the right spot here, and then I can collect that half down. And are you able to pay that by card today? Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Give me just one moment here to get to the right spot, and then we can collect that half down for you. Okay, thanks. All right, thank you so much for holding there. So it looks like half of that amount for that would be okay. All right. And whenever you're ready, I could take the type of card first. Yes, Visa. Okay. And does that end by any chance? Yes, it does. Okay. Expires on two, correct? Right? Yes. Okay, perfect. It looks like we have that one on your file, so I'll go ahead and just charge that cardia. Would you like an email to receipt? Yes, please. Okay, sounds good. And the email I have is your first name, last name@gmail.com, correct? Yes. Okay, perfect. I went ahead and got that sent over for you, and then I will get this in front of the warehouse, and as soon as I hear back, I will give you a call either way and let you know.

I'd like to talk to someone about making an appointment to have them come out and look at my boiler. Steam boiler. Okay, sure, I can help you with that. Is it not working right? Do you just need a tune up? Well, I need a little more attention than what I can do for it. But the feeder on it, it's a Vxt 24, and the water is bypassing the feeder and it's overfilling the boiler. Okay. And then there's let's see the safeguard deal with the limit control. I took it apart and cleaned it and put it back together again, but I'm not familiar with the electric part of it or anything of that nature. Like I said, it's never been skimmed. And I think I need somebody to come in here and kind of look the whole thing over and repair this feeder valve if that's what it needs. Okay. And then to send our technician over there is a diagnostic of $150. Do you know how old the unit is, by chance? It's about 28 years. I built it myself. Okay. And then we've got availability today or any other day the rest of this week. Is there a day that works best for you? Well, today would be perfect. Okay. I wouldn't have an exact time, but we would call 15 to 30 minutes in advance prior to arrival. All right. Okay. What's your address, please? It'd be 16080 East Chestnut Street in Mount Eaton, Ohio, 44659. Where are you located? Oh, yeah, because we're located in Barberton, but we do service your area. Yeah, that's what the whole $150 thing is all about, too. There's always a diagnostic charge. It's only $60 if you're on our maintenance plan. If you're not on the maintenance plan, then it's $150. Yeah, well, one way or the other, I got to do something because I have to have this thing back in order before winter, by all sense of the word. Okay. All right. Hold on 1 second here's. All right.

Okay, and then what we'll do is we'll call 15 to 30 minutes in advance prior to arrival. Okay. And this would be before 05:00? Correct. You think? If you're not available after that, I can note that, and then we will definitely try to work around your schedule. Yeah, because somewhere around 05:00, I'm going to have to disappear for a little while. I don't think I would be gone long, but I'd still want to be here, of course, when they do show up. So if it's before five, then just tell them everything is fine with that, but tell them to call me if it's going to be after five. Okay, not a problem. Okay. All right, I have everything noted. We'll give you that call as soon as we're ready to send him over. Is there anything else I could help you with? Nothing at this point, I sure. Thank you. All right. Okay. Thank you.

It's working, but I'm starting to develop ice around the lines and stuff. And looking out at the condenser outside, I got some ice forming up around the lines out there and everything, so I know it's not supposed to do that. Okay, and is this for Lincoln way in orville? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so with it freezing up, they actually wouldn't be able to do a diagnostic until I had thawed. Would you be able to turn the unit off? I can run this one out there for you tomorrow.

Thank you for calling Blenden Suns. This is Kate N. How can I help you? Hi, we have a call in for electrician for service and I was told they would call about 15 to 30 minutes ahead of time. I received an unidentified call, but the call, it rang twice and then it didn't go through any further. I was just wondering if that was from one of your electricians or it was, I don't know. Got you. Okay, is this for the four nine one? Is it McIntyre Drive in Wattsford? Yes. Okay. Yes, so I don't show that that was us that called, but we still do have you on our schedule. So as soon as that electrician does become available, we will give you a call and let you know. Okay. Do you happen to have any best guess if you think it might be today? And the reason why I'm asking is because it's for my parents, they're both 90 and they have an upright freezer full, and if somebody can't come today, I'll have to buy a freezer, like a freezer for my house to transfer all their stuff because it'll be 48 hours without electric. Got you. Okay. Yes, I still do show that on our schedule we do take anyone with health concerns or elderly as our priority. So we do have someone available, we should be giving you a call to let you know. Oh, thank you, that's a huge relief. Okay. And could I also add a note that if by some chance they should get my voicemail, if they just leave a message? Because sometimes the cell reception, the calls, like I say, they don't go through all the way, but then people will get my voicemail. So if they could just leave a message, I will be hyper vigilant about it. Yeah, absolutely. We always leave a message if we aren't able to reach someone and then we do have to hear from someone before we send the technician. So once we hear from you, we'll get him sent that way. Wonderful. Oh, I appreciate it so much. I'm going to sleep or sleep, breathe so much easier. And I'll probably sleep better tonight too, because both my parents, they're both 90 and they've been sleeping on the couch because they don't have any power upstairs in their bedroom. And so one's been on one couch and the other one's been on the other couch and it's been not quite the picnic, so thank you so much, I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you. Have a good one.

This is Ellie, how can I help you? Hi, Ellie. Do you do water heater repair and or replacement? Yes, we do. I fear my unit, my water heater is not going to last much longer. I've got some leaking from the pressure valve and really need somebody to take a look at it if possible. Okay, absolutely. Right now I am scheduling my plumbers for tomorrow, but if you're available, I can get you on the schedule for then. We'd give you a call on the way. I wouldn't have a set time. I'm sorry. Hang on a second. I'm going to turn my volume up a little bit. I missed that last part. You have availability for when I could get someone out as early as tomorrow? I just don't have a set time. We would give you a call on the way about 15 to 30 minutes in advance. Yeah, so here's the hard part for this. I don't know, we're kind of a moving target as well because of work. And obviously I've had to shut the machine down because we don't have hot water, so we're motivated to get it fixed. But, um, Wednesday or Thursday would be possible at all or do you know? Yeah, so Wednesday I could do would be that same set up where you call ahead. Otherwise, Thursday I could do an arrival first thing at 08:00 A.m.. Okay, let's let's set up Thursday at 08:00 A.m.. But I'll call you back if for some reason that doesn't work out, okay? Absolutely. Now, sir, have we been to the home for you before? I'm sorry, what? Have we been out to your home before? I don't think so. Okay. May I have your address, please? Sure. It's 5505 Wagon Trail. That's in Medina. Thank you. And may I have your first and last name, please? My first name is Brandon. B-R-A-N-D-O-N. Last name is Singer. S-I-N-G-E-R. Thank you. And Brandon, is this the best phone number to reach you, the 421-9651? Yeah. Probably just leave a voicemail because if it's an unknown number, I probably won't pick up. Sure, I understand. If we don't reach you, we'll leave you a message. That's no problem. Would you like to place an email address on file for any receipts or estimates? Yeah, I probably should. B like boy, S like Sam, and then the word farm, but with a PH instead of an F, so BS farm. Okay, then the number 2000 at@hotmail.com thank you. All right, so are you looking to replace the unit or see if it's repairable? Well, we're probably on borrowed time. I'd prefer if it was repairable, but sure. It's 22 or 23 years old now. Probably going to need replaced soon anyway. Sure. Okay. Both quotes, free estimate. Okay. Yeah, because it would be a free estimate to replace the but yeah. Let's get someone out there to take a look and see what we can do for you. Brandon, I've got you set here. We said that was Thursday morning at 08:00 a.m.. They'll give you a call on Wednesday just as a reminder, and then he'll come out for you first thing. Okay, so let me ask you this then. The appointment Thursday morning, would that be just an assessment? And then we would have to reschedule the replacement of the unit so he would come out and assess first. If you do decide to move forward, I know we do stock some of those here in our warehouse, otherwise we'll be able to obtain one for you. If you do decide to move forward in the same day, would that be something that we would be able to do the same day, or would that be something that would have to be rescheduled if they had one in stock? No, if he's able to do it, I mean, if we have what's needed, then, yeah, we would be able to take care of you in the same day. Okay, but Thursday, we've got a bunch of other stuff booked. But if it is that we need to replace it, I will derail all that if it is that we can replace it. But I would hate to do so just for him to come out and give me an estimate and then not be able to replace the machine. So I get that that's dependent on whether or not you have what we need, so that I understand, but it just helps me to plan a little bit. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. All right. And I've noted here that you are interested in same day, so that way they can at least have a heads up there, but perfect. We'll get out there Thursday. I'm sorry. Yes, thursday morning, the third at 08:00 for you. Okay. All right, thank you. All right, I appreciate your help. Have a good day. Yeah, you too. You're welcome. Thank you.

This is Keaton. How can I help you? Hi. This past winter, we had a generator installed, and about a week or so ago, we had a storm where the power was going in and out and in and out for about 15 minutes, and then it finally went out. And the long story short, I think the in and out kind of blew a circuit downstairs, and so I was wondering if we could have somebody look at it. Yeah, absolutely. Is this for eight, three, four minor road? Yes. Okay. And then the number that you called in from, is that still the best one to reach you? Probably the best one is 330-388-3400. That should also be on the account. Okay, absolutely. I do show that one here. So did the generator not kick on then, or was it having problems? No, it was kicking on and then going off and on and off and on and off within a very short period of time because the actual power would come back on. And then it got confused. The generator got I think it was all happening cycling so fast. Once the power went out, actually, the generator worked fine. So I guess there's two things there's the circuit that blew and can we get it so that if there is an issue like that, it maybe takes a little bit longer for the generator to kick in. That way it won't get confused. Got you. Okay? Yeah. Let me look here. Give me just 1 second. I show that was installed around six months ago. So do you think that the generator was the one that blew that fuse? Maybe. I don't know exactly, but it happened as a result of that. Got you. Okay. I just want to make sure I had everything right here in the notes. So since the unit is less than a year old, we would label that as what we call a possible callback. If it is anything in relation to the generator or the install, there would be no charge for them to come back out if it's related. If it is unrelated to that, the service call fee would be 120. If they come to the home and realize it's unrelated. Yeah, whatever it is. Yeah. And we have availability tomorrow or any day after that. No, tomorrow would be great. Okay. And for tomorrow they are routed on location. So I would just have an arrival sometime after ten, but we would give a call when they're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. Okay, that sounds good. All right, then we should call the 388-3400 number. Correct? Yeah. Okay, sounds good here. I have you all set then. And we will give you a call as soon as we have that electrician available tomorrow. Okay, thank you very much. Yeah, thank you. Have a good one. You too. Bye.""",Existing Customer - Lead Booked,None

Good morning. I was on the Blend and Suns website and I found out that the company does offer some electrical work and some financing for some residential electrical work. Yeah, absolutely. Awesome. Yeah. So I'm in Ravenna. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm here. So about a year ago, my neighbor's tree fell and it kind of disrupted my line going to my house and they are still attached. And I've had power, but I lost power to some outlets and then I've had some lights flickering and now some lights don't work and some of my plugs don't work or my outlets. So I think I'm kind of under the impression that I need some work done now. Yeah, so I was just kind of trying to figure out who to call and financing and all that kind of stuff, and I came across your website. So I was just kind of trying to figure out the next steps moving forward with it. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So we would want to get someone out there to come take a look, see what's going on and provide an estimate for you. There is a service call fee to get him out there to the home of 120, and then any work he does would be additional. Okay. After he provides those estimates, he can go over how the financing works. They are more informed about that in the field than we are here in customer service. Yeah, you would just take whatever that estimate is. I know there's an application online for financing and he can walk you through all that. If you're interested, I could get someone out to you as early as tomorrow. Yeah, what times do you have tomorrow, if I could ask? Yeah, absolutely. Let me take a peek here. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're very welcome. So tomorrow I wouldn't have a set time. We only schedule their very first calls of the day and then they're routed based on job type and location. If you're interested in the first call, I could do Thursday. That's the third at 08:00. A.m., got you. You see, I'm actually work from, like I work from, like, 730 to about four. So I don't know if you guys do anything after four. They only run until about that time, until about 05:00, so I'm not sure we do all also run on Saturdays. Can I give you a call back? Absolutely.

I'm going to say replacing because I don't think we're adding. Okay, what has you looking to replace? The current one. Is it not working right or just old? We have an old model. We built this house. I'm trying to think of what year do we build it? Probably in 2006, about 17 years old or so. Because my son was one ish when we built this house. And it's never been replaced. It had some repairs done once or twice to it, if I remember correctly. So now it's R 22 system, so I'm sure we're going to need a whole new thing with that. And then it's leaking water all over the basement. And one person said we could add more R 22 and change the coils. But by the time you do that, you're about halfway to a new air conditioning unit. Yeah, but my husband doesn't really want to do that. But the problem is I think 15 years is probably about the right time. Yeah. Usually they say about 1520 years for an AC. And especially if it's R 22. That is very expensive right now because they're not making it anymore. Yeah, he said that it was like he said that we'll probably need a pound, but it's one of those things do you gamble and just put a pound in and then hope that it doesn't leak fast? Right. So it's like the gamble the whole thing is a gamble. That's really what the problem is. I don't know. So I'm just calling to get quotes and see what we want to do. My parents use you guys. My coworker Antoinette, her family used to I think they sold it, but they used to own this. Okay, well, I can use your parents as a referral if you'd like. That's fine.

I make a lot of the decisions, so you tell me when somebody's coming. They can be first available. Okay. I mean, I do have availability as early as this evening, so it's up to you. Evening.

I am calling because my mother's air conditioner, she had it installed by you over the winter, and I have two issues. One is it's making a very unusual noise that I can't identify. And the other issue is, when they installed it, it was winter months, and they said they would come back out this summer and finish setting up the outside so that it would drain. And so now there's water pooling all around it. And they said I had to call this summer and talk to somebody to get you to come back out and fix that. And is it rosemary on North Roundhead Drive? I'm sorry? Yes. I didn't say yes, it is my mother, Rosemary binnen. Okay, thank you. Let's take a peek. All right. So the unit, you said, is making a lot of noise, and you said that they told her to call. Have them finish setting the unit up. Well, the unit is set up, but they put in a cement pad, but the ground was frozen, and then they said they couldn't finish the exterior kind of layout of it, if you will. And so now there's water pooling all around it. Okay. Sorry, I was getting that typed up here. Okay. All right. So I can work to try to get someone out for her today. I just don't have a set time. They would give a call on the way about 15 to 30 minutes in advance. Okay, let's have them call my number then that I've called in on, the 406-209-4711. Okay, absolutely. We can give that number a call. Here, let me just put that in the notes. Okay. And this is Teresa. It is okay. And I am going to put this in as what we call a possible callback warranty call. That just means that if it is related to that install, there would not be a diagnostic charge. If somehow it was unrelated as a maintenance member, it would just be $60 instead of $150. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I would understand that it could be related to the initial, but it might not be. So we'll see what develops, right? Yeah, absolutely. Let's just get them out there and see what's going on. For you. And then Teresa will give us number a call as soon as we're on the way. Okay? Thank you so much. Thank you. Take care. Okay, bye.""",Existing Customer - Lead Booked,None

And there seemed to be some disconnect between the thermostat and the air temperature. Like we had it on set to 72 and thermostat had 75 most of the day yesterday.

Please check the schedule of the electrician and let us know. 330-418-0032 so the gentleman came out, gave us an estimate for all the electrical repair.

We wouldn't consider that emergency. No. I could get somebody out, but I would be looking at Monday.

Like, I guess I shouldn't say emergency in that form. There's not like sparks or a fire or anything, but the component I need fixed runs my dough mixer and I need my dough mixer to make my dough every morning. So I was really hoping you would have an electrician available this evening or like very early tomorrow morning. Basically what I have is a three phase mixer, but I don't have three phase electric available at my location. The way this mixer has been running for the last 40 some years is off some two phase system with another component added to it. The electrician I spoke to a little while ago said that you can run the three phase mixer off of a two phase setup, but I need an inverter. So I think the part that the electrician needs is an inverter. I just don't really know. But I really need somebody to come look at it like ASAP and hopefully fix it fast because without no, I cannot make. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I actually apologize. We actually do not do commercial work. We are residential only. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Do you know any emergency electricians that do do commercial? I do not.

Don't. Thank you for calling blend. And this is Katen. How can I help you? Yeah, I actually have a couple of questions for you. I've used you guys before for hvac stuff, and actually last time I had somebody in, they said that you did plumbing as well. And I have a plumbing issue, so I guess I would like to set something up. I also had a question. I'm going to be going through my home warranty for it. I wanted to make sure you guys had, I guess, a previous relationship with America's preferred home warranty. It makes it a lot easier for me if you do. Yeah, sure is. Okay. Yes. So to get our technician over for the plumbing, we do have a service call fee of 120, and then they would give the upfront pricing from there. And with home warranties, we are able to work with them, like if our technician needs to call them on site while he's there with you. But other than that, they would have to call into us for any questions they may have that may not have been answered on site. And then we do require payment at time of service. So we would require that and then they would have to reimburse to you. Okay. So that's your hard policy on that one? Yes. Correct. All right. We can make that work. So, yeah. With the van said, though, the issue at hand is there's a sewage smell that based on what I've been, I'm just kind of troubleshooting on my own. It seems like there's probably just the drain line going out of the house, inside of the house. There must be a crack or something in it or something because it's not a consistent smell. It's just been kind of Intermittent. And I've got to kind of identify where it will guess where the smell first shows up and where it's strongest. Hoping it's just a simple pipe that needs to be replaced or maybe even. Maybe even a 90 on it. It's gone bad. Got you. Okay. That's my hope. But obviously you guys are the experts. If I knew all the answers, I could do it myself, and I don't. Yeah, absolutely. Do you have availability for a plumber tomorrow or any day after that? Tomorrow sounds great. Okay. And for tomorrow they are routed on location, so I don't have an exact time as of now, but we would give a call when we're on the way 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. Okay. There is a time that I won't be available. My daughter has a doctor's appointment at 08:00 a.m. So I won't be there from probably quarter till eight until, let's call it 9930. Oh, yeah, absolutely. That shouldn't be a problem at all. It most likely would be sometime after ten, so that shouldn't be a problem at all. Okay, perfect. Cool. And they'll call or text. You guys usually give some sort of a notification when somebody's on the way, right? Yes, we'll give a call 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. And should we call you at this number? Yeah, that's perfect. I work from home tomorrow, so I'll be there to have a couple of meetings and things like that. So I want to make sure that I'm 100% available for you. Okay, sounds good. Well, I have you all set then for tomorrow for that plumber. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yeah, actually I had one other question for you. I guess unrelated to this. So the homework I'm also. Have my dryer decided to stop working over the weekend? They said sometimes plumbing companies, HR companies do dryer repair. Is that something that you guys do with the Samsung dryer or is that something I just call. Okay. We figured I would ask recommend more of a handyman for that type of work. Very good. Then I will start figuring out who to call on that one. But tomorrow you guys will be. That's awesome. All right, sounds good. Well, I hope you have a great day. All right, you too. Thank you.

I'm thinking about selling, and I just want to make sure everything's up to code and stuff like that. Did you try a plumbing inspector, sir? Actually, no. You guys were the first number we seen, so we called you because it said inspection. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah, we can only do request inspections on jobs that we have permits on. So, like, if we did an installation that required a permit, then we can request an inspection from Summit county for a permit inspection. I can give you their phone number. You can try and give Summit County a call, and they should be able to direct you on who can get that inspected for you, sir. Somebody through the city. You're saying it can't be a licensed plumber? If you're looking for an inspection, a code inspection, you'd need to contact the summit county building department. Okay. And what's their number? It's 330630. Okay. 7280. Okay.

So at a tenant apartment, the tub has pretty significant water damage under the tub and the subflooring, and I'm a little concerned about them using it. I don't want them falling through the floor. Do you guys only do plumbing or could you handle the subfloor as well? Yeah, we only do plumbing. We have a company that helps us with the rest. The restoration one is typically who helps us out with that kind of work. Okay. Restoration one. Okay. Yeah. They might be your best to start with because they'll actually be able to point you in the right direction once they start doing, coming in there and seeing what exactly is going on, they can usually pinpoint what the issue is and then give us a call if we're needed. Okay. And then how soon are you guys able to get out when you do come out? Because I'm trying to get this done quickly because I'm probably going to end up putting the tent in a hotel until I could get it repaired. Got you. It just kind of depends. Like right now, what was I looking at? I'm probably looking at Thursday right now as my soonest to be able to get somebody. Okay. Okay. I'll give them a call. You said restoration one? Restoration one, correct. Yeah, Tina, I think she's one of the managers over there. She's usually pretty good, but anybody you talk to over there should be able to help you out. Okay.

Thank you for calling Blenden signs. This is Holly. How can I help you? Hi, Holly. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing great, actually. I can't complain. I actually just had a simple question because I'm a little. Because we had, I live here in Cleveland and we had a flood warning and my hot water tank went out and I just turned it back on. I had to do the knob six times and it turned back on. Okay. In order for water to come out of my faucet, my hot water, because I got cold water coming out of my faucet but not hot water at all. And I checked all the hot water valves. They're all on. Does the tank have to fill up with water in order for water to come out of the faucet? No. There should already be water in there. It might be taking it a while for the water itself to warm up. Well, okay. My friend turned off my hot water, but he had turned it back on yesterday before he left, but now there's no water coming at all out of my faucet like the hot water should. You see what I'm saying? But only cold water is coming out. But not water for the hot faucet. I know it's not going to come out hot. I know it's going to come out cold, but there's no water coming out at all. Okay. Do you have a single handle or double handle faucets, like hot and cold? I think it's single. If I'm not mistaken. I just bought the house, like, four months ago. So I'm a little bit confused. I don't know if I checked. Come on, Selena. I checked all the valves, all the hot water valves in the whole entire basement. Now, is it just one sink that you're having that issue with? No, the bathtub. I'm having problem with that. The whole entire, like what you call it? The whole entire hot water in the whole house, only cold water is coming out. The furnace is on. I could see a little bit of water coming out of the bottom of the furnace, or I see water coming out of it. But how is water coming out of it? I don't have no water coming out of the sink. Yeah. You're sure that he turned all the valves back on? Yeah, I turned it all back on. I see the valve for the cold water on top of the hot water tank. Okay. But I don't see a valve for the hot water. Did you see if the kitchen sink underneath and the cupboards has its own separate valve? And the same with the bathroom. No, I haven't checked that. Because I know, like, at my house, I have a valve under the kitchen sink. One under the bathroom sink. Okay, let me see. There is a valve under the sink for the hot water. Okay. Did you try turning that? It's actually on. Yes. That's od. Yeah, it really is because I've been trying to do it all morning, and I don't know if just to shut off the hot water tank because I don't know if there's water going in, but I see water coming out of the hot water tank into the ground. Yeah. You shouldn't be seeing that either. You would have to get a plumber out there. Honestly, I don't know what the. You said you're in the Cleveland area. What's your zip code? It's 44120. Okay. So with us being located in Barberton, unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to send one of our plumbers. So what I would do, if you have access to the Internet, is to do a search on Angie.com, because we know that's a reputable website to find the closest licensed plumbers in that Cleveland area and around that zip code. Okay. But, yeah, I'm not sure. That doesn't make a lot of sense. If he turned everything back on. Yeah, he turned everything back on, and it was water coming out of the faucet yesterday, but now today, I don't know if it's because the tank is empty and it doesn't have water in there. The waters are not coming out of the closet. The hot water is not coming out, but the cold water is. Yeah. I mean, if there was no water in the tank, then no water would come out at all, whether it was hot or. Well, how much water do you have on the floor? It was some water on there already from yesterday. It's not a lot of water. I mean, it's not a lot of water coming out. Okay. Yeah. Honestly, I wish I had an answer for you, but I would definitely do a search on Angie, and that's angi.com. Just type in what's going on, what you're looking for, which is a licensed plumber, and then it'll bring up companies that are reputable. Okay. All right. Okay. Because I just wanted to see if the hot water tank needed to fill up with water by itself in order to water to come out the faucet for the hot water. Yeah, it might, but, yeah, it's hard to say because then you have a little bit of water underneath it, too. The pilot has been on already for, like, 30 minutes, and it still haven't shut off. Okay. So it's not leaking at the inside or anything. It's just water is not coming out of my faucet. But I had the water tank off all night. Right? Yeah, maybe. It could be. There might be, like, air bubbles in the lines. Yeah, I would definitely just call a licensed plumber in your area. Okay. But should I just shut off the hot water tank to be safe? It's a power flex, and it has a pump and everything. It's plugged into the wall. I'm not really sure because I'm definitely not a licensed plumber. I would see if you could get anybody out there as soon as possible and maybe ask, I don't know, a company up in that area. But with me not being a licensed plumber, I don't know. Okay, well, I will make sure that I give somebody a ring. Okay. I really appreciate your help today. I really do. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. Have a good weekend. You too, honey.

Do you know if it's a heat pump? Is that what you're speaking of? Does the unit sit outside the home? No, it sits inside. In the wall. Got you. No, we do not work on those. I'm sorry. Okay. Trying to find a place that does. Yeah, I'm not really sure who would work on those. Do you live in an apartment or a condo or something? Apartment complex. Yeah. Got you. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm not sure. There's nobody there that can point you in the right direction at the apartment complex. Well, I put in the complaint about. It's a leak. The ac part of it is leaking, and I don't know how to pageant myself. I told them about a week ago. They said they tell maintenance and they never did. I keep trying to call back and they don't care. Gotcha. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yeah, unfortunately, we don't really work with apartment complexes either, but. Yeah, I wouldn't really know what to do. I'm sorry. Would you happen to know any. I've already called a bunch of places over here in Akron and they all turned me down. Would there happen to be any places up there that you could think of in Akron? It could be Akron. Or in. Really, the only other place I know is up farther north in. I'm not. Other than us around here. I'm really not. Have you. Did you try like Jennings or anything like that? Jennings, yes. Let me see. I don't think I called them. No. Yeah, they're another one I know about, but other than that, I'm really not sure. Okay. I just thought I'd ask. No problem. Thank you.

Sa thank you for calling blind and suns. This is Katen. How can I help you? Hi, I just have a quick question. Do you work at all with plumbing dealing with septic systems? It depends on what it is. What's going on with that? Were you. Well, actually, it has to do with my leach bed. I have some tree roots that have grown into my lines out of my distribution box and I didn't know if you guys do that kind of work. I'm sorry. Yeah. So were you looking to get that snaped or jetted out? I don't know that it can be jetted out. It's possible that, I know there's sometimes there's something that you can go in and remove roots like that, but I don't know if the line would have to actually be replaced or you could actually do it that way. So I didn't know if you do that kind of work, if you actually had to replace those leach lines. Do you do that kind of excavating work to do that? Got you. Okay. Yes, I do know that is not something we are able to do. I know we are able to snake those out or our sister company would be able to check them out. But we are able to replace. Okay. The roots look pretty because the neighbors had planted some trees and it has grown in there and it's been in there for a while. They look like they're in there pretty tight. Can you sometimes remove them when they've been in there a while and they're big, they're not little tree roots or maybe they're a combination of a bunch of little roots. But anyway, it looks like big roots. You know what I mean? They take in the circle of the distribution box hole where the pipe fits in. And so I didn't know if you do that kind of work, if it could just be taken out, that'd be great. I just didn't know if maybe the line would have to be replaced or if they could actually be done that way where you can have them taken out that way. Is that possible? Yeah, at this time. I just don't believe that is something we would be able to do. Okay. Yeah, I know. Not everybody does that. And that's why I thought I would just double check, because it's very possible that the lines may need to be replaced if they can't get the tree roots out. Okay. All right. Well, thank you for your help. You. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Okay, bye.""",Out of Service Capabilities,None

Good afternoon. This is Michelle Anis and I have Hartville hardware here delivering a washer and gas dryer. They have stated that flexible piece on the dryer that attaches to the floor. They said that the rigid piece that comes up out of the floor, the vent doesn't have enough of a lip on it and they need a professional plumber so they're unable to attach that little flexible coil to the floor part. So the floor is tile. Obviously that piece is rigid. He said he tried pulling it up or whatever. So I have no idea what the fix to that would be. If they just have like a coupling piece and then attach the coil and clamp it. So our plumbers actually don't specialize or do that kind of work for us. That would typically be our guys that do our duct work. Typically. And unfortunately, I don't have anybody available for that kind of work right now at all. Or just not like this week or today. I'm looking at September for scheduling that work right now. Dear Lord. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yeah, typically that would be somebody that does a dryer vent cleaning or does anything with vents usually is who I would think you would need for that kind of work. Okay, so you're saying that it's not really a plumbers. No. So it'd be like an HVAC place or not even that. You could just find somebody that, again, does dryer vents stuff. And they are typically, usually the people that would help with that kind of work. Got you. Okay. I didn't even know there were dryer vent people, but something every day, right? Yes. All right. I'm so sorry we couldn't help. Recommendations? I don't. Unfortunately, I have no idea who else does that. Again, if you just want to look up any sort of like duct cleaning or vent cleaning, which we do. Again, I just don't have any availability until September. Yeah. Okay. All right. I will see what I can come up with. Thank you so much. Have good one. Bye bye. Thank you. You too. Bye.""",Out of Service Capabilities,None

And then the number that you called in from, still the best one to reach you? That would be correct. Okay. And then I do have another number on file. 440-717-9727 is that still accurate?

So the first available we have, we would be looking at Monday as our soonest. Okay, sorry, go ahead. Oh, yes. I was just going to say to get our technician over, the diagnostic fee we have would be 150. And then they would give the upfront pricing from there once they're at the home. Okay, that's fine. Okay. And on Monday, they are routed on location. So I don't have an exact time at the moment. It would be sometime after ten, but we would give you a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. That would work. Okay. And last thing would be, do you know around how old the air conditioner is by any chance? I do not. I want to say ten plus years because it's not the original, but maybe ten years old.

Thank you for calling Blenden suns. This is Holly, how can I help you? Hi, Holly. I am calling to see about scheduling service and to potentially get an idea of how much it would be to schedule a service call. Okay, and what kind of service were you in need of? I believe it's going to be plumbing. Okay. Do you have a leak? Is there a drain backing up? No. We have an issue where when the cold water is running, we have fine water pressure. It's not as strong as it was before, but it's better. And as soon as the hot water kicks on, like in the shower, it's just a barely trickle. So I don't know if there's a clog in the hot water tank or there's a leak somewhere, but for some reason we've lost water pressure. Okay. Sure. So to send one of our plumbers over, there is a service coffee of 120. We don't charge anything by the hour, so everything is upfront. Pricing. He would quote the price of the repair or the upgrade on site. And then we're currently scheduling for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week. Okay. We could potentially look at Monday. How do you do scheduling? Do you do a time block or a specific time? Yes. So we only scheduled our 1st 08:00 a.m. Appointments for the day and those are booked. So it would be next available. That means I wouldn't have a time, but we'd call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay, great. Why don't we go ahead and schedule that? Okay. What's your address for me, please? It is 6262 Redbird. All one word, terrace. And that's new Franklin, 44216. And you said red bird, correct? Right, red bird. Yes. Okay. And first and last name that you would like on the account, it'll be Erica, E-R-I-C-A. Lynch, L-Y-N-C-H. Okay. It'll be easier for her to pay. Best phone number is 330-949-8976 okay. And that's her cell phone? Yes. Okay. And you're at 330-347-8329 yes, that's me. That's correct. Okay, so let me add hers. Do you have a preferred email address? Sure. It's eheath one at kent. Kent.edu. Okay, let me make a note here. And you said when you use the cold water, the water pressure goes down. And then in the shower, it's just a trickle. Well, no, the water pressure used to be stronger. Within the past week, we've lost pressure. When the cold water is on, the pressure is decent. But as soon as the water heats up, the pressure decreases further towards just barely a trickle. Okay. And the water heater has been replaced within the past five years, so shouldn't need replaced. But that's what makes me think maybe there's just a clog. Okay, so I've got everything noted. I have you all set for Monday, July the third. As soon as we get a plumber freed up in that Clinton area, we'll give her that call 15 to 30 minutes in advance prior to arrival. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much. All right. You're welcome.

It is eight one two mark drive, Akron. Perfect. Is this Steve? Sure is perfect Steve. Thanks so much. What's going on? What can we do for have? So I'd like to get the furnace just the regular inspection, cleaning, tune up, whatever. And also for the air conditioner, I guess. Is there a difference between just checking them out and doing an actual tune up? Right now we are only doing air conditioning maintenance things. We don't start furnaces again until September. But when we do an ac maintenance they will inspect the blower motor like the major components of the furnace. So they do kind of still check some areas out near the furnace, just not a full inspection. But they will do a 19 point inspection on the air conditioner and then they would just make any recommendations if needed that we have a special for $79 right now. Okay. And then I'm also looking online. I see the HVAC free tune up on old equipment. Is that applicable for what we're doing? Um, I don't know. That's a good me. Let me ask. Give me 1 second ok? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Okay Steve. So yes, we could go ahead and honor that for you right now with this visit on the air conditioner. Great. Okay, perfect. Right now I am going to be looking out at that week of the 10th. Would there be a day that week that would work for you? That week would be fine. Or weeks thereafter? A Thursday or a Friday would be preferable. Sure. Yeah. So it's a time frame that I would be able to give you either between nine and one or one and six, of course. Yeah.

And the ac unit, the part that sits outside, is making quite a bit of noise, a lot of buzzing. Okay. I thought maybe I'd have someone come out and take a look at it. Sure. What's your address for me? Yeah, it's six five seven talcron. That's spelled t as in Tom, A-L-K-R-O-N drive. All right. And it's Darryl Allison. That's correct. Thank you so much, Darryl. Yeah. So the outside condenser is making some pretty loud noise. It's buzzing pretty good. Yeah. I mean, it usually would make noise, but it seems to be a lot louder now. Pretty loud. Okay, so we can address this a couple of different ways here for you. Sure. I could set you up on a maintenance appointment which would get us out to do a checklist, check everything out, and then make any recommendations if needed. That is a $79 visit, and I could get somebody out towards the end of next week for you. Otherwise, it would be a diagnostic appointment to get somebody out sooner. And that is $150.

What would you prefer? Either one would be good for me. Okay. I'll go ahead and add you on here for today. What we would do is as soon as we were able to get one of our guys freed up near your Akron area today, we would give you a call about 30 minutes in advance. Okay, perfect. There is a possibility at the end of the day that I have to go pick a car up, but that's probably around five or so. I just want to let you know that now rather than if you guys call me, I'm like, darn it, I'm not home right now. No, that's fine. Thank you for letting me know that. It should be before that time. But I'll definitely make a notation just to be on the same. So I appreciate that. And real quick, Darryl, the best number to reach you is at the 330-606-3420 that's correct. Yeah. Perfect. I've got you all set. We'll be in contact as soon as we can. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. No problem. Thank you. Bye.""",Existing Customer - Lead Booked,None

We recently had you out in April to fix one of our toilets. We live in Florida part time. We just returned, and the toilet is leaking profusely, and I'm not sure where, but literally, I have to bring out towels from this, and I'm hoping my floor is not damaged, but I need to have the plumber come back out and take a look at it. Got you. Okay. Is this for 1396 San run road? Yes, ma'am. Okay. And then the number that you called in from, is that the best one to reach you still? It sure is. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Yes. So is that leaking even when you're not using it? Yeah, I'm looking at it right now, dear. It's, like, leaking. He took it apart to replace, like, what I'm going to call the flushing mechanism inside the toilet. It looks like it's leaking where he put it back together. It's leaking between the seat and the tank is where it appears. But it's literally like, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. Got you. Okay. Yeah. So we can definitely get a technician out. Sure. We want to try to get someone out this afternoon, if you'd be available. Yeah, I know you guys can call if they're on the way, which will be perfect. Okay. And then to get the technician over, the service call fee would be $30. However, I will note that we did just do that in April. And if it's something that they warranty, then they can go ahead and adjust that from there. Yes. Sounds good. And the second thing, it may need to be a different appointment either way, I have a sink, for lack of better terms, in a bathroom that has two sinks, but the one sink is needing. The bear with my ignorance here on how to explain it to you when you close the stopper. That part, it needs to be replaced, and it may be something the guy can look at when he's here, and then we can just reschedule for him to come back out. I just wanted to see if that's a possibility or if we need to get a second appointment. I can do that as well, ma'am. Yeah, no problem at all. Since we already are going to have a plumber coming out for you, I will just go ahead and note that. And he should be able to look at that while he's there as well. Perfect. I appreciate it, dear. Yeah, and then we'll give you a call as soon as he's available, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand for this afternoon. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks. Have a good day. You, too.

What we want them to look at, I guess, is what I mean. I'm so sorry. Could you repeat what you just said? Sure. No, we want them to come out and look, but I can't tell you over the phone exactly what. There's so many different things. But I report when they arrive and they could look that way. Sure. Yeah. I could get somebody out for the electric today if you're available. Yeah, that would be great. Perfect. And what is the address? It's 80 seven Wallwood Drive. Walwood. W-A-L-L. Wood. All one word.

Because I'll have to have a realtor at that house. Got you. I would say it'd probably be within the next maybe hour or two. Okay. Is that okay? I think so, yes. If it isn't, I'll call right back. Sure. Yeah, not a problem. And we'll definitely give you the heads up. We try to give you about a 30 minutes call in advance. Would that help you at all? Yeah. Okay. And then I'm just going to notate that you have several electrical things you want to go over with the technician due to buying the home, and just go over your options with that. The plumbing portion, I would be looking at either tomorrow or a day next week. Okay. Tomorrow would be good for plumbing. Okay, let me see. Tomorrow is the 30th, and then it would be the same. I wouldn't be able to provide a time, but we would call you once we have them available. It'd be after 10:00 a.m.. Okay. Yes, I think both of those are fine, but if not, I'll call right back.

My name is Steve Corlis, and I had you folks out here last week to test my water, and they identified that I had some iron bacteria growing in it. And so consequently, I had, this previous Tuesday, had a company come out and treat my well, which killed a lot of gunk and stuff like that. And one of the problems I have is my downstairs bathroom, the sink. There must be like a dramatic plug of gunk in there that would not come free. And underneath the sink, the water is leaking terrible. So I need someone to come out and take a look and correct that. Okay, what's the address for me, please? 5785 Dave Drive. Okay. And this is an extra bathroom, so it's not a rush job or anything like that. So I just need to get it scheduled to have someone come out and correct it. Sure. Absolutely. So I see that you have the maintenance plan with us now to send him over. It would just be that $30 instead of the 120. Okay. And then any work we do, you'll get that 15% discount. I've got availability tomorrow or any day next week except for Tuesday. Yeah, actually tomorrow would work. I'll be home. Today is not. But tomorrow works great. Okay, let me look at their schedule here real quick. All right. So it looks like they all have their first call. Steve. It would be that next available where we call 15 to 30 minutes in advance prior to arrival. Okay. Yeah, just be sometime during. That's fine. Yeah. I've got a home number at 330-896-0876. Yes. Cell number 234-738-9668. Correct. And email address is jj@aol.com that's correct. Okay, let me make a note here. Okay, Steve, I have everything noted. You are all set for tomorrow. As soon as we get a plumber freed up in that Clinton area. We'll give you that call 15 to 30 minutes prior to sending him over. Very good. I do have another question. They had me shut off the water softener when they did the servicing of the well and such. Is it safe to turn that back on again? Because they told me it would harm the system if I put it on too soon after they put the chlorine in the well. It's been two days. Should I turn it on or just wait for that guy to show up tomorrow and we'll do it then? Yeah, because I really honestly don't know, Steve, if you're able to wait until tomorrow and then just do it while he's out there, that might be best. If you. If you're willing to wait until tomorrow. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And I'll just add that to the notes here. Yeah, just throw it on there. It's just pulling a lever, so it's no big deal. Just didn't know if we could do it yet or not. Very cool. Absolutely. We'll get her all taken care of tomorrow. All right, perfect. Sounds like a plan.

So in the summer, it doesn't need to be off running. It only runs during the colder season. Thank you. It makes sense as you say it to me, but I didn't. Yeah. No, you're okay. I appreciate your help.

And they're telling me that I need to install a 220 volts outlet for charging the car. Is that something I can get you guys to come out and at least scope out and possibly also do? It is. Yes, we definitely do those installs for those outlets. I could work on getting an electrician out for you tomorrow if you'd like. Oh my goodness. You are quicker than I can handle because I'm actually calling from out of town. How about sometime on Saturday? Would that be a possibility? Let me see what Saturday is looking like. I could try, but I couldn't make any promises. So I would add you to our board and then we would give you a call once we had one of them free up. So I wouldn't be able to provide a time, but we would definitely try. Okay, I go with that. And if not, maybe we'll spill it over to next week. Yes, that's exactly what we'll do. So we'll add you for Saturday, give it our hardest, try to get somebody freed up for you. And then if it doesn't work out, we'll try for another day. Sounds like a plan to me. Perfect. What is the address? It is 65 21 blackfrier is one word. B-L-A-C-K-F-R-I-A-R-S. Lane. Thank you so much. And your first name for me, please? My first name is Abhijit. A-B-H-I-J-I-T.

And it'll only be a $30 service call fee instead of the normal 120. I appreciate it. And will he be or she be doing the work or is it just a scoping exercise right now it depends on if they have all of the materials needed to do it at that time. If not, they may need to schedule us to come back out. I believe they normally have the stuff needed, but if not, they'll come out, assess everything, give you pricing, and then schedule a day to come back out because I have the hardware already sitting in my office, meaning Tesla has sent me whatever they want on the wall. So I suppose it's a hookup question. And I'll need to go back into the switchboard, so. Yeah. Well, we'll play by the year. Let's see what happens then. Yeah, if you already have that part, it should be relatively easy to get done then, and we'll just kind of take it by Saturday. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. You have a great day.

I wouldn't have a set time tomorrow, but they would give a call on the way about 15 to 30 minutes or so in advance. When you say estimate, they won't do the work. They're just going to look at it. Well, it depends. Do you have the toilet or would we need to obtain one? I am just about to purchase the toilet. Okay. Yeah. So as long as there are no ods and ends that they need, if they have everything on the truck, absolutely. They can take care of you in the same visit in the same day. Okay. So the toilet will come with some of the stuff, but if there's like two missing or something, they have that gear. They do drive fully stocked vehicles, so yes, it's possible that they would have any miscellaneous items they may need. If they do need to order anything or make a return trip, we could do that as well. Okay, perfect. I would like to schedule it if I could. Yeah, absolutely. Would tomorrow be okay for you? Yes. Okay. All right. And then again, they give a call ahead when they're on the way. Is this 216849 number the best way to reach you when we're on our way tomorrow it is. Excellent. Okay. Let me get that updated and then do you still have the email address, Kchristman one at neo rr.com? I do. Okay. Thank you. All right, Karen, I have you set here for tomorrow. That's Thursday, the 29th. And they'll give a call about 15 to 30 minutes ahead before he comes out to the home for you. Okay. Is there any window time? Window? Sometime after 10:00. They do have their first call scheduled, and then they run until about 05:00. Okay, perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Ellie. You're welcome. Have a great day. You as well.

This is Holly. How can I help you? Hi. I was calling to see if we would be able to schedule to have somebody run a hot water line out to our backyard, just out to the back faucet. So our basement is not finished, so it should be a relatively easy thing to do. Is that something that you guys would be able to do for us? Yes, it is. We would need to schedule for a plumber to come out. And then there is a service cost fee of $120. We do not charge anything by the hour, so everything is up from pricing. Okay. And then we actually just had you guys come out and fix our ac yesterday, and we had signed up for the yearly, essentially, like, service maintenance plan. So with that, what would be the actual cost to run a hot water line out there? Okay, what's your address so I can pull up the account, please? 7554 Southridge Circle northwest. And that's north can 44720. This is Jessica. Jessica. Yes. All right. And phone number 303-28-5210 yeah, that's correct. An email address is j l and then S-O-V I@gmail.com. No, it's actually Jlhsovi at Gmail. Okay, I'll fix that. And that was going to be. The other thing is I never got a receipt or anything from yesterday because I think the email was wrong. Okay. Let me send that over here first. So with you being on the maintenance plan, it's only $30 to send him over instead of the 120. And then any work we do, you'll get a 15% discount. Okay. Do you know about how much do you think it would cost overall? Because you said $30 for him to come out and then I'm not sure. Jessica, I'm definitely not a licensed plumber, so I have no idea. He would have to be the one to quote that for you. Okay. Because if it's going to be something reasonable, then absolutely we'll have him come out. But if it's something that's going to be in excess of 200, $300, there's no way. So I kind of just want to have somewhat of a ballpark. All they have to do is just run a line about 30ft to an existing faucet that's already on the outside. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, if we could, let's still try and get somebody scheduled to come out and take a look. Okay. So I've got availability tomorrow or the rest of this week. Is there a day that works best for you? What time tomorrow? Tomorrow. Let me double check here. The 29th. And then I did send that receipt and stuff over, too. Okay. Into your email. Okay. So tomorrow I would not have an exact time because all of the plumbers have their 1st 08:00 a.m.. Appointments. Could be morning, could be afternoon, but we give you that call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay, that's fine. Yeah. Let's go ahead and schedule for tomorrow. Okay, let me make a note here. And you said it's about 30ft that needs to be ran? Yeah, that's my guess. And there's already an existing faucet out there. We just want to actually physically have a hot water line out to it. Okay. And our house is only five years old, so we have whatever that flex plastic, whatever tubing stuff is. I don't know what it's called. It. Okay, Jessica, I have everything noted. And then you are all set for tomorrow. So as soon as we get a plumber freed up in that area, we'll give you that call 15 to 30 minutes prior to sending him out. Perfect. All right. Appreciate it. Thanks. All right, thank you. Have a good day. Take care. You, too. Bye. Thank.""",Existing Customer - Lead Booked,None

Yes, I do have, like an AC and furnace through your company, but I was calling regards to see if I get scheduled duct cleaning. I've never had my ducts cleaned in my house. I've been living there. Okay. Yeah. And is this for Hearthstone Road in Parma? Yes, it is. Okay. All right. Let me take a look here. All right. And do you know by chance how many vents you have in the home?

And that's okay if you don't have an exact count right now, I want to say it's probably between 15 and 20 because I have three, four bedrooms. That's usually two beds in each bedroom. That's eight. Two bathrooms. Yeah. Probably about 15 to 20, I want to say. Okay, I definitely get a call tonight, but between. Okay. Yeah. So for any amount up to 14 and you just have the one furnace, is that correct? Yes. Okay. So any amount up to 14 would be 501 plus tax. And then anything over 14 would be an additional $15 apiece.

I could try to get someone out there actually this afternoon, or I'd be looking at Friday, which is the 30th, sometime between twelve and two. Okay, let me think this afternoon.

Let me get that open. All right. So we said that was this Friday, which is the 30th between eleven and two. And then they'll give a call on the way for you about 15 to 30 minutes or so in advance. Is there any way I could do request like a 30 minutes? For sure? 30 minutes because it takes me about 30 minutes to get home from my job. So that way I could work until I get the phone call and then I can just head home and I'll be there. That way timing is about to get right when they're arriving. Absolutely. Or even they can do 45 minutes. Just give me a little heads up. Okay. Yeah, no, I can make sure we give you at least a 30 minutes notice when they're on the way. Okay. They could do 45. That'd be even better. But 30 minutes would be great. Okay. So at least 30. Okay. 45 would be great. Got that noted here for you. So perfect. Sir, that is Friday the 30th, again between eleven and two. And they'll give you that notice when they're on the way for you. Okay. And then is there anything that I need to do to prepare for this or just become in and just take care of everything? Yeah, they have access to all of the vents. Okay, that's what I was looking at. Yeah. Because I need to do some rearranging each vent. Got you. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, just me and make sure I get all the vents because there's one room that's kind of upstairs. It's kind of like chaotic right now. So I'm going to see if I can do to clean up that room, get access to all the vents then. Oh, got you. Okay. Yeah, no, that sounds perfect, sir.

I think I had it serviced in 2019 by you, and they put forth, I think I had a complete coil put on there. And since then they had to come out and put gas in there, I think one time.

And that's where the well pump is. That's how the septic tank works. But for that pump to work, there's electric that feeds the pump inside there.

Hi, good morning. I've had two furnaces put in by blend and a lot of other work. I got a general question I don't know if you can answer. You put an April air unit on my one furnace and I'm redoing an upstairs den that has your modern panel temperature control thing with controls, the April and everything right underneath this guy. Really old one that I want to remove. I don't think it's live or anything. I think it's just there because like I said, you replaced the furnace hand and put a new April air in. Do you know if there's someone that could tell me if I can just take that off the wall and patch it up and paint over it? Does that make sense? Got you. Okay. And was it an old wider then or an old humidifier? It's an old April air thermostat unit. That's like really old. It's probably from the 50s. It's just hanging off the wall. It's not really even fixed to the wall. And secure it. It's right underneath that big paint. I can send you a picture of it. Actually, I took a picture just in case you, I'm just being extra cautious. I'm pretty sure that it could be just snipped and cut because it's not operational. But I just wanted to call before I did that. Is there a technician I could talk to or someone who actually installed the furnace? Got you. Yeah. So the way that we would work for that, we don't have any technician by phone. We do have to send a technician to the home, but he could look over everything and then let you know if that would be okay. Yeah, I'm not going to pay for a service call just to have that done. Just wanted to get a general advice. Would you charge for that? Yes. So to get the technician over, the diagnostic fee, since you're on the maintenance plan, would be $60. Yeah, I think I'm just going to cut it. I don't think it's going to do anything. Okay. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks. Have a good one.""",Existing Customer -  Lead Not Booked,Price Shopper

Okay. Yeah, that would be good. I won't be home, but somebody else that lives there will be. Okay, and what is the name that you would like on the account? Deborah Bishop. Okay. And the address? 1349 Lockwood Road. And that's Coventry Township. Okay. And the number that you called in from, is that the best one to reach when we're on the way? Yeah. 330-289-0518 okay. And then the last thing is, they are paperless in the field. Do you have an email that you'd like to keep on file? No. Okay. And is the unit not turning on at all or blowing warm air? It's running. I have a feeling the Freon. I've lived in my house for 70. I've never had it serviced, so it's probably out of Freon, I would say, because it was working yesterday. And then today after I got home from golf, I'm like, it's a little warm in here. And then I looked at the thermometer. It was like 75 in there, which shouldn't be that warm. Got you. Okay. And do you know around how old the air conditioner is, by any chance? I really have no idea. Okay, no worries. And then on Monday, our technicians are routed on location, so I don't have an exact time, but we would give a call when they're on the way. 1000 to 30 minutes beforehand. 15 to 30 minutes. Okay, that sounds good. All right, well, you are all set and we will give you that call on Monday. Okay, thank you so much. Thanks. Have a good one. All right, you too.

You know what? You. Good afternoon, this is Becky. How can I help you? Yes, I was wondering if you give free estimates on new air conditionings. Hello? Yes, we do. Okay. What it is, is when I bought the house, it looked like they put a brand new furnace in, but they left the older AC unit. But the AC unit is not working now. So I would just like to get an estimate on putting a new one in. And those are free estimates? Correct. We will send a consultant out to your home. No cost, no obligation. They'll go over everything with you. We do like to allow 60 to 90 minutes. It may not take that long, but we just like to allow that much time in case you have some extra questions or anything like that that you would need to go over with them. They'll give you all your different options. Go over any financing. If you need that. They can go over all of that with you when they're there. Okay. And do you know about how old the air conditioner there is? It looks pretty rough. I bought this place in 2015, and the furnace was brand new back then. The AC looked rough back when I bought it. It just stopped working last year. It's probably 15 years, at least. Yeah. So I really wasn't going to replace it because I just opened my windows. But since then, I had a pacemaker put in and I figured I'd better get a new. So. Okay. All right. So it does not look like we've been to the home before, so I need to get an account set up for you here so we can get somebody scheduled. What is your first name? David. And the last name? David? Richmond. Richmond. And the address there? I'm sorry? There's a train going by nearest, so if you hear that in the background, I do apologize. I hear a train, too. Yes. Okay. Yes. As soon as you said you heard a train, I heard the same train, maybe. Okay. And your address? Two. Two West State street. And that's Barbadon? Yes. Do you know where Angie's is at in. Yes. Yeah, we're right across the street from Angie's. Yeah. See, I don't know if that's the same train, because the one I'm hearing is, like, down towards Kenmore, but I can hear it clearly, so it might not be the same train you would think it would be, but I don't know, it just seems like that would be pretty far. Yeah. All right, David, the phone number that you're calling from, the 21633 710 twelve, that is a cell phone number. Yeah, cell phone. Primary cell phone only. But it's my only number. Okay. Yeah, a lot of people, that's all they have nowadays. Okay. And do you have a day of the week or a time of day that normally works out best for you? I do have some doctors appointments scheduled, but I think it's starting, like, the 9th? Twelveth. I just got home today, so I got to look at that. But I think next. Actually, you know what? Let me just get it out. I want to take my second. That way we don't. Tomorrow. If you would like it tomorrow as well. Tomorrow? Yeah, that'd be fine. I do have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at noon in Hudson, so I should be back. Or early in the morning would be good. Tomorrow I have 09:00 a.m. And it only takes him, like, 90 minutes. You said 60 minutes. Yeah. So he'd be out here by ten or 1030. Yeah, that should be fine. I'd be able to make it up to Hudson by then. And then I always told myself, and I'll have to see what he says, but I said, whenever I have to get a new ac, I'm moving it to the back of the house. So I don't even know if that's possible. Just because. Yeah, go for that with him when he's there, he'll be able to let you know if they can change that because I don't know how much, like, the ventilating and everything. Yeah, it'd be nice to put it in the back. David, our guys are paperless. Do you have an email address that we can place on file? Yes, it's Richmond. R-I-C-H-M-O-N-D-J as in Jill, C as in cat 41 at@gmail.com gmail.com. Okay, thank you. And, David, is there going to be anybody else at the home or anybody that's involved in, with helping making any of the decisions? We do have all the decision makers there, if at all possible. Yeah, I'm the only one that lives here. Okay. My daughter's picking me up for the appointment, so she might be here, but. No, I'm the one that was here. Okay. All right, well, we've got you all set. Where did you find our phone number at? Actually, you've done some work on my neighbor's house across the street. And you've done some work, I believe, for my ex wife. I just googled you on the Internet, but I already knew. I said your name and googled you pretty much. I've known people that you've done work for. Perfect. Okay, so we've got you all set for tomorrow. The gentleman that's going to be meeting at the home, his name is Lee, and he will get you on right away. Okay, great. Have a great weekend. Okay?

We would however, though, call 15 to 30 minutes in advance when an electrician and a plumber would free up in the Akron area. Okay. Gosh, I hate to do this. Can I take this appointment now and then? If my husband, for some reason, because he wants to be here and his work schedule doesn't allow for it, can I call and cancel tomorrow morning first thing? Yeah, absolutely. I would just need to get the information here, get it booked for the electrician and the plumber. If you need to cancel, you can call us anytime. Okay. What's your address? Okay, so 1776 brushtire. B-R-O-K-S-H-I-R-E. Road. All right, let's get this here. And you said that was in Akron? Correct? 44313. Correct. Okay. First and last name you'd like on the account. Monique. M-O-N-I-Q-U-E. You know what? Just go ahead and put Bob. Sorry? Bob, my husband, Bob Coulterman. Okay. K-O-L-T-E-R-M-A-N. Okay. And the best phone number, 703623. Is that a home or a cell? That's a cell, but it is our home as well. Your cell phone? Yeah. Okay. So I know I told you his name, but I'm giving you my cell phone. I guess you should just put my name. M-O-N-I-Q-U-E. Okay. And the preferred email address, please. Culturemanfamily. K-O-L-T-E-R-M-A-N-F. Like fox amily@gmail.com. Okay. And then you were cutting out a little bit. Monique, you said your last name is spelled K-O-L-T-E-R-M-A-N. Is that correct? Correct. Yeah. Okay. All right, so I'll get you on for Monday, the third for both the plumber and the electrician. If anything changes on your end, then just give us a call back anytime. Okay. Do we need to have the. I guess we would have to have the washer and dryer pulled out of the closet so they could see where to fill the hole, correct? Yeah. Okay. All right, great. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Monday, anytime. We just don't know. So just anytime after ten? Yeah, I would say anytime after ten and then sometime before four, but we'll definitely call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay.

But I could change his appointment to a free estimate if you'd like. I can give you the model number and brand of what I have. Maybe they could look it up and see what they'd have. Would be equivalent. I'm not a real Bradford White fan, though, I'll tell you that. Oh, I see. I've had a lot of failures with Bradford White. Oh, really? Yeah. Carl, they don't do any pricing over the phone, only in person, on site. All right, well, they're going to come out here and charge me $120. I guess they can see if they can fix this one and give me an estimate at the same time. Yeah, we could do it that way. Or I could just change it to an estimate. It would be no charge. Well, when could they come and do the estimate? I could get someone out as early as tomorrow. They would give a call on the way. Well, we're going to be leaving here about, probably about 11:00 tomorrow. I won't be back until after the end of the workday. Should have to be really early in the morning to work for us tomorrow. I just hate to go all weekend with no hot water. Yeah, absolutely. Well, I can keep that Friday appointment and just change it to an estimate again, there'd be no charge for the visit. They would come out and provide an estimate and make a plan to get it replaced. Yeah. I even know which piece the code says is wrong. Is it a possibility they could bring the part with them when they come Friday? Or is it going to be come Friday and then come back sometime next week to put the part on? Depending on what is needed, they may need to order it. If that's the case, they would need to make a return trip. But otherwise, they do have soft vehicles. If it's something that they would have on the truck, they could make the repair. Right then. Well, this is a lock and bar, and if you guys are selling Bradford whites, you probably don't have many lock and bar parts on your truck. So that's my guess. Universal one, right? Yeah, it's a TCO, or pressure switch. Failed open. That's what the code. I. I see that note here. Yeah. So it won't fire up because that switch is open. Oh, I see. Yeah. I don't know that they would order any parts without seeing the unit first and running their own diagnostic, but, yeah, they would have to come out there and kind of see what's going on for themselves and then go from there. Well, just have them come on out Friday to see if they can repair it. I don't know whether it'd be a different guy or the same guy, but could the guy come out Friday, also work up an estimate? Yeah, when he comes out on Friday, he can give you an estimate at that time. That's not a problem. All right, then we'll do it that way. Okay. All right. I'll leave this as is then, and we'll see you on Friday, and we'll give you that call head, and he's on his way. Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks. Yeah, you're welcome, Carl, thanks for calling. Have a good day. Okay, you too. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye.""",New Customer - Lead Booked,None

This is Holly. How can I help you? Hello, we have a about seven year old water heater. A lock and VAR is the brand. And I understand that you service those or sell them. Is that correct? Okay, service? Yes, the ones that we particularly quote are the Bradford whites. Okay. Well, this was a new house and this is what they put in it. We're looking for service because we have a light that's flashing telling us that the pressure switch has failed, is open and we need to have it repaired. Sure. So we are currently scheduling for tomorrow or any other day the rest of this week. Is there a day that works best for you? Well, if we're talking about tomorrow, what time are we discussing tomorrow? I wouldn't have an exact time. Pardon me? I wouldn't have an exact time. We only schedule their 1st 08:00 a.m. Appointments for the day and those are booked. However, we do call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Well, the reason I'm asking is there is an appointment already set that would be difficult to reschedule. So let's talk about Friday. Friday. Okay, let me look at Friday here. I mean, essentially I have no hot water. All I have is warm. So I'm looking to do something quickly. But tomorrow is difficult if you can't pinpoint closer. Okay, it looks like Friday would be the same thing. Next available, and then we call you prior to sending him over. All right, well, let's do that. There will be someone here all day on Friday, but not true on Thursday. Okay. What's the address for me, please? This is in Medina. It's 31 97 Ridgewood Road. Okay.

The home phone. Okay. Yeah, the home phone. Is there a preferred email address? Yes, sholb 2698@aol.com. Okay. And then to send him over, there is a service coffee of $120. We don't charge anything by the hour, so everything is upfront pricing. And then shall we call the sell or the home number first? Try the sell first, and then go to the home number in case it's busy if needed. Okay, perfect. All right. I will get everything noted here, get you guys on the schedule for Friday, and then we'll give that call as soon as we are ready to send him out. All right. Thank you much. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Okay. All right, so you're looking for a heat pump and a furnace? Yes. Correct. Yeah. My furnace and heat pump were installed at the same time. And they're a little bit older. They're 25 years old. So I figure with the new heat pumps and the new coil assemblies, we're going to have to go ahead and replace the furnace and we'll just do it all in one shot and swallow that pill. All right. You said the heat pump is not working? No, ma'am. I mean, it turns on and all that, but it's totally out of refrigerant. And the outside looks like the outside coil is leaking. And it's a 25 year old Linux unit, so there's no fixing that. Unfortunately, it's going to have to be replaced. All right, I'm sorry, what was your first name again? Was it George? George.

And our guys in the field are paperless. Do you have an email? They'll send you all of your estimates and things via email if you've got one absolutely. It's my nameGeorge Harvey, 78, at@gmail.com okay. All right. So do you have a day of the week or a time of day that does typically seem to work out better for you? We do like to allow them 60 to 90 minutes to kind of go over everything with you, go over all of your different options and things along that line. Afternoons are better because I can always take the afternoon off of work. Okay. What do you have available? Not really. I mean, I'm pretty flexible as far as that goes. Okay. So I think the phone cut off. You wanted to know if I had anything available. What mean, what's your scheduling look like? Are you a week out, two weeks out tomorrow? You never know. Soon. Okay. George, is there going to be anybody else that we're meeting at the home with you? We do like to have all the decision makers there at one time, if at all possible. Yes. My wife, her name is Dina. D-I-N-A Harvey. And she works out of the home. She has a home office. Okay. She's always there. Perfect. All right, so let me take a look. Let me pull up one more thing. Tomorrow is 29th. All right.

Yeah, I was calling to see about having scheduling someone to come out and take a look at my water heater. I don't know if it kicked off sometime either Sunday night or I didn't notice it until yesterday evening. My water heater, the pilot light went out and I got it relid or turned back on, but just a little bit of water at the base of the water heater and still it's kind of there today. It hasn't really dried up much and I don't know if it's leaked a little bit more. My pilot leg has never, in my 17 or ten years at this house, it's never kicked off. So I'm not sure if the water heater needs repaired or fixed or just kind of want someone to look at it. Got you. Okay. Yeah, that's definitely something we could help with. And to get our technician over, we do have a service call fee of 120. And then they would give the upfront pricing for the repair once they diagnose what's going on with that unit.

Do you have an email that you would like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? Yes, it'll be Anthony eckinger@gmail.com. Okay. And is tomorrow the best day for you? Yeah, that works. Okay. And for tomorrow, our technicians are routed on location, so I don't have an exact time. As of now, it would just be sometime after ten, but we would give a call when they're on the way 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. Okay, yeah, that's fine. I'll plan on working from home. Yeah. Okay. And then you said there was some water around that hot water tank as well? Yeah, not much. I mean, you see a little bit of rust on the side at the base of the water heater. That's why I think there may be none of the pipes look to have any water that it doesn't look like any pipes are leaking. So I suspect it's probably. There's maybe something on the actual water heater that's leaking. Got you. Okay. Email. No worries. Well, I have you all set then, for tomorrow. And then we do need to speak to you before we send him tomorrow. So when we give that call, 15 to 30 minutes before, definitely just answer and let us know that we're good to go. Okay, that'll work. All right, well, we will see you tomorrow. Have a great day. All right, you too. Bye.""",New Customer - Lead Booked,None

I've got maybe two weeks tops to get this furnace fixed or to get the air conditioner fixed. Okay. Yeah. We could definitely get a technician out and to get the technician over, the way that we work is we do have a diagnostic fee of 150. And then they would give the upfront pricing for the repair once they diagnose why that use is not working. Okay. All right. And we have availability for a technician tomorrow or any day after that. Any day after tomorrow. Tomorrow is a crazy day for us. Okay, no worries. And what is the name that you would like on the account? It's going to be under Frank Thomas Polling. Well, Frank T. Polling. Okay. How do you spell the last name? Poling. Okay, and what is the address, please? One. 40 South Thomas Road, lot 35. And that's Talmud, Ohio, 44278. All right. And the number that you called in from, is that the best one to call when we're on the way? Yes. Okay. And then is there an email that you'd like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? Yes. Polling polin garenber@gmail.com okay, sounds good. And do you know around how old the air conditioner is? And if not, I have no idea how old the furnace is. It looks to be fairly new, but I don't know for sure. Okay, absolutely no problem. I can almost guarantee it is fairly new because nobody's had to clean it yet. Got you. Okay, sounds good. And then you said that any day after tomorrow. Would you like to stay there Friday? You know what? I'm thinking Monday would be better because I'm still in the process of moving. Could we do it on Monday? Yeah, absolutely. And on Monday they are routed on location, so I don't have an exact time. As of now, it would just be sometime after ten, but we would give a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. That would be great. All right, sounds good. Why have you all set then, for next Monday the third? Is there anything else I can help you with? No, not a thing. Perfect. Thank you. I hope you have a great day. I will. Thank you. You, too. Thanks. Stay dry. You too. Bye. I will. Bye. Bye. She wanted to come through stair Friday.""",New Customer - Lead Booked,None

Thank you for calling. Blend and sun. This is Ellie. How can I help you? Hi, Ellie, this is Lisa Shears. I'm having an issue with the hot water heater, and I just bought this house back in September. And your stickers on the hot water heater, and it looks like they come and flush and fill it. So I was curious to know what that entails because I just hooked up to city water here because the water was horrible on a well. And it's like the hot water still looks orange coming out, but if you put it on cold, it's not. So I'm thinking it has to do with the hot water heater. But the hot water heater is working. You know what? I. I just moved here from Pennsylvania, so I'm just going by the sticker on it and seeing if someone could fill me in. But it looks like they've been here three times to flush and fill. Okay. Last time being in 2020. Okay. So it sounds like maybe the unit is about five or six years old. Well, it says 916 2011. And then in 615 16, flush and fill. And 213 18. Flush and fill. So it's like they're coming every two years. And like I said, I bought it in August, but I never moved until just a month or two ago because I had it all redone. So it would be time for this flush and fill. But maybe I need, like I said, I think it's gas. Hot water heater. Average life is what, 1015 years? So I don't know. I don't know the puzzle. I just know that the hot water is still rusty. Well, it looks rusty, but the cold is not. Okay. Yeah. Well, Lisa, I could get someone out there as early as tomorrow to come take a look and see what's going on. If it is a flush and fill, they could do that for you. Otherwise, if there's something else happening, they could let you know. Okay, what's your cost for that? So to get him out there to the home, the service coffee is 120. Any work would be additional? We don't charge anything by the hour. It's just by the job itself. Do you know what a flush and fill is? Yeah, if it's just a flush and fill, we have a special going for $59 right now. Okay, that's all it is. It would just be the $59. But if you were to do any other kind of diagnostics or any additional work, that service coffee would apply. Okay, that's fine. Can I make an appointment, then? Yeah, absolutely. So I could get someone out as early as tomorrow? I don't have a set time, but they would give you a call on the way, about 15 to 30 minutes in advance. That's fine. Thursday. Okay, Thursday. What? On Thursday I could do a first call. It would be an arrival right around 08:00 a.m., well, I work part time. I'm retired, but I work part time and I'm working until noon the next two days. So if they call before noon. My sister lives eight houses down, and she'll be home. And afternoon, I'll be home. So tomorrow is fine. We'll just go with that. Okay. All right, perfect. Okay. Lisa, is it shears? S-H-E-E-R-S-S-H-E-A-R-S? Yeah, with an a. Thank you. And what is your address there? It's 59 20 Shermont. C-H-E-R-M-O-N-T. Northwest Canton. 44718. Thank you. And is this the best phone number to reach you? The seven one seven number? Yeah. That's my only number. Yeah. Perfect. And then, Lisa, we are paperless in the field. Would you like to place an email on file for any receipts or C-L-K cj@gmail.com? Actually, I'm looking here. It looks like my furnace is from you guys. Too lined in sun. I probably will be calling you again at some to have it blown. Yeah, so we do it all. We do plumbing, electric, heating and cooling. So if you need any help in any of those apartments, just let us know. But we have you on for tomorrow. That's Wednesday, the 20 eigth.

I just don't have anyone to walk you through. Can you look at my contract? Yeah, I do show the contract here. Does it show a transfer switch should have been on the contract? Yeah. So I show that we installed that. It looks like it was in 2020. So I do have a transfer switch. Yeah, that's when I show that the box was installed. And it looks like the notes say portable generator outlet with interlock, relocate some circuits. And the new box in general, I would imagine it would be part of that generator outlet. So I'm not sure, since I'm not a licensed technician, but those are the notes that were from the original job. Okay. I need to know how to use the generator outlet. I don't even know where it's at. Got you. Yeah. So what I would recommend to get a technician over, since you do have that maintenance plan, would only be $30. He could get over to the home to look over everything for you and kind of show you where. Why do I have to pay for something that they should have shown me when they installed it? Yeah, so since it was two years ago, it would only be. I went looking for it. They left no instructions on how to use it or anything. Got you. Yeah, that would just be our service call fee to get them over. It's normally $120. That maintenance plan you have does make it only $30. Well, guess what? I have a service call scheduled for tomorrow. Maybe he can show me how it works when he's out here walking around without any power. Got you. Yeah. So for tomorrow, it is for the air conditioner I show. So he's not an electrician, unfortunately. So he won't be able to show you anything within the box. Okay. All I need is a phone call. Yeah. So we would have to send a technician out that is just our policy. I don't have anyone by phone. Well, why didn't they do it when they were out here the first time? They did a really bad job of installing that breaker box to start with. Got you. Yeah, I do show. We were out there, and it looks like 2020 for you. And then. Is there something wrong with the box? Well, yeah, they ran the cable above ground instead of underground, and they ran it right near a couple real sharp pieces of metal. So far, it hasn't hit the metal, so it's been. Okay, that's the cable that goes into the box from outside, but, yeah. Okay, I'll go read the name on the box and look it up online and see what it says. Okay, sounds good. We're here. A few need us.

Back in December, when we had some hot days, I had an air conditioner turned on in the house. And for whatever reason, the outside unit, I think you call that the condenser, right? The outside unit? Yes, because this is split system. And at any rate, I was in the back of the house, close to the outside unit. All of a sudden I heard this big sound go.

My name is Brian Frederick. You guys installed a generic generator for us. Actually calling for two things. One, the maintenance light popped on, and so I know I've got a maintenance contract with you guys. I just want to know how that works. If you have somebody come out, it's the green and yellow one. So I don't think it's anything urgent, but I think we're due for maintenance on it. The other thing is, I wanted to get somebody to come out and give me a quote on a new AC and air handler. Okay. So I can help you with scheduling the maintenance on the generator, the AC and handler. I would need to get you over to our other representative. It is a free estimate. So just like the generator, we would get a consultant out to the home to go over everything with you and go over pricing. The generator maintenance is $200. I could arrange that for you, though, any day this week. So generator maintenance is not included on a maintenance plan. But I'm also not showing that you have a maintenance plan. Interesting. I had a note that I had paid $120 to you guys. Let me take a look here. So our maintenance plan is actually $198. The 120 was a service call fee. From what I'm showing when they came, it looks like they came out to look at the ceiling fan, I believe. Okay. That was something different. Okay, no problem. Okay. Are we on the same page then? I think we're all on the same page. So the maintenance for the generator is 200, right? Yes, sir. 200. And that's for anybody. Even if you were a maintenance customer of ours, it's not included under that maintenance plan. So it's 200 flat rate for all customers. Okay. So what's included on the maintenance plan is 198. WhaT is that? So that's going to cover the air conditioner and the furnace. So that gets you one maintenance visit. Got you. Okay. Yeah. So when you do the AC consultant estimate, they could probably work with you on becoming a maintenance provider with that, if you do decide to go with a new air conditioner and whatnot. Got you. So when they come out and is that $200 for just general annual maintenance on it, or would that be to come out? Am I required to change the oil? Does that include oil change on it? Yes, sir. So that $200 is paying for changing the oil. It's going to change the filter for the oil and the air. It's also going to replace the spark plugs. And then they're going to check the generator for any signs of damage. They do a whole checklist under that. $200. Okay, well, let's get that scheduled, and then you can pass me over for the AC estimate. Sure, that sounds great, Brian. And what would be a good day for us to come out and do that generator maintenance for me? Hang on just a second. Let me pull a calendar up. What are we looking at in terms of time wise? So we only schedule their very first appointment of the day. I don't have any first appointments for the rest of this week. Otherwise. I can do any day this week. But we would just call you once we have a technician freed up in your area. Okay. Do you have any first appointments next week? Yeah, let me take a look here. I could do Tuesday next week. Let's do it. What is the first appointment? What time? So that would be 08:00 a.m.. Okay, cool. All right, perfect, sir. I'll go ahead and get you down here then. Hold on 1 second for me, Brian. Okay. Yes. All right, thank you. Okay, Brian, I've got you all set for April 11, next Tuesday, 08:00 a.m. For the generator maintenance. And then I'm going to get you over to Diane, and she'll schedule you for the estimate on that AC and handler for you. Okay, cool. Thanks, Brian. One moment, you. Thanks for holding. This is Diane. Hi, Diane. My name is Brian Frederick. I wanted to have somebody come out and Take a look at my AC and handler and give me an estimate to get it replaced for the air condition. Okay? Yeah. All right, give me one moment. Brian, you're at 39 60 Ellendale Road in Moreland? Correct. Okay. All right. And the number you're calling from, the best one for you? Yes. All right. And we do have BRF 98 at Hotmail. Is that still a good email? That is great. Okay, you said this is for air condition? Yes. All right. And is the current one work or did it stop working last year? No, it works. Okay. Working, but it's old. I've actually got another estimate, but I wanted to get an estimate from you guys before I make a decision. Okay. All right, well, the appointment, we like to have everybody available who'd like to be there. So morning, afternoon, evening, what works best? Pretty much. Mornings are generally better. Okay. All right, let me see morning. Well, I have availability yet this week. I'm just trying to see what a I can do afternoons, too. Okay. No morning should be fined. I got Wednesday. Would that work? I got a 09:00 a.m. Or an eleven. You know, what if we did eleven? I've got a call from ten to eleven, but I would be available at eleven, so that'd be fine. Okay. All right, I will let him know. Wednesday at eleven, no earlier. And just allow him about an hour of your time and we'll give you a courtesy call day before as a reminder. Okay, sounds good. And who's going to be coming out? I have Kevin's scheduled. Kevin? Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. All right, we see you then. Thanks for calling us. Have a great day. Bye.

No. And then afterwards, this is a deal. I haven't been part of the maintenance plan for a while now, I think. What is the monthly rate for the maintenance program right now? Monthly rate is a month. One time payment is. Okay. And then that gets you a summer and a fall cleaning, correct? Correct. Anything else? I can't remember if that gets you anything else. Yeah, it covers you for a year. You get the priority service half off of all of our service call charges, including the electric and plumbing department. Any work that we do, you get a percent discount. Okay. Can I sign up after my cleaning then? Or you can sign up anytime. Or is it better to sign up, help me out from the pricing. If I sign up now, will I have to make up that difference for the cleaning? Or if I. You know what I mean? No. So if you sign up now, then we would just do the month and then we would not charge the dollars, but then the AC maintenance would go under the plan that you sign up for. So I don't know if you wanted to start it now or start it in the fall. Whatever is easiest for you, honestly, Matt. Yeah, let's sign up now because it sounds like either way I'll be paying what that price is. I think it's like a $10 difference if I pay it all now, right? Where otherwise, if I do it monthly, I'm saving because I don't have to pay so much now, right? Right. Yeah. Okay. Point a month. So I got to delete that work order now because we're going to put you on the plan. Apologize for that. That's all right. Find my wallet. Where did I put it? Here we go. Collect and apply. Is it going to be off of a MasterCard? Visa? Discover? I have a Visa card whenever you're ready. Okay. You have one moment here. And how does the name appear on the card, please? Matthew H. Beagle.

All right, then I'll have you down here for that $99 tankless Descale again. You may be able to talk to the technician to see if there's something else on his end he can do.

Daniel Jackson calling. How are you? Hi, Daniel. I'm well, thank you. How are you? Good. Okay, so we had a generator installed last week by you guys. And part of the promotion was that it's a ten year warranty, parts and labor. So I went into the app that I have with the generator now, and it's not reflecting that information. Do you have an answer for that or do you know what's going on or what? I do not. Is this for Stockbridge Road? It is. And do I have to send in information for the warranty or do you guys. No, we register the equipment with the manufacturer. So let's take a look. Okay. All right, I see how we just did that install. Let me see if I've noted that it's been registered, so it doesn't show specifically that it has been. Typically they do register that equipment before it's installed, but I can reach out to that department to see if they have any information on that and give you a call back. That would be fine. I appreciate that. Do you have my number there? Okay. Yeah. 330-41-4083 yes. Your phone or headset is crackling really bad. Thank you. We are having some phone issues. I will pass that along. I appreciate that. Daniel, let me do some research here. I'll give you a call. Thank you. Appreciate the help. You're welcome, sir. Take care. You, too. Bye.

I was hoping to schedule a time for someone to come out. We have a number of outlets in our house that don't seem to be working and we can't figure out where the breaker is or what's going on with them. And then we have some lights in the basement that have the same issue they previously worked and now we've changed the light bulbs and did everything we can figure out to do and nothing's working. Yeah, we could get somebody out there to take a look for you right now. I would be looking at tomorrow. Now we do have a service call fee. It's $120. That's going to get us out to the home to assess everything for you. It is able to be reduced. They'll come out and give you all options. We do all upfront pricing so we don't do anything by the hour or anything like that. So after they give you all the upfront pricing, if you accept any of our estimates, I can have that 120 cut in half to $60. And that's just tacked onto the bill for us coming out and doing the assessment. Okay, that's fine. Would you like to get somebody out tomorrow? Is that standard for electricians or just for your company? I'm not sure, to be honest. I do know most places have a service call fee. I don't know what their standard is. Most places absorb it, though. Once they do the work, it's only if you don't. All right, let's just schedule it and I'll call around and see. I'm not available tomorrow. Do you have anything Thursday the 6th? Yeah, I should be able to do that day. So we only schedule their very first appointment of the day because we never know how long they'll be in a home for. So I could do an 08:00 a.m.. Appointment. I do have that as an option. Otherwise, if that's too early, we would just have to call you once we get somebody freed up. No. 08:00 a.m. Is great. Perfect. And what is your address? 33492 Hanover. H-A-N-O-V-E-R. Woods trail. And that's in Solen. All right. And that's 44139. Thank you. And your first and last name? Rebecca. R-E-B-E-C-C-A-M. Bacher. E-M-B-A-C-H-E-R. Thank you so much, Rebecca. And then I have 216-392-0348 Is that your cell phone? It is, yes. Perfect. And then our technicians are paperless. They work off of a tablet out in the field. So to get you any receipts or information, do you have an email I could put on file? Sure. It's beckyembacher@gmail.com. And then just to make sure I'm not signing up for any sort of list, right? No, ma'am. No. This would only be sent to you for receipts and whatnot that you ask for. Perfect. So I will get you down here for this Thursday, April 6, at 08:00 a.m. We will call you Wednesday. We call all the 08:00 a.m. The day before to confirm those. And then our technician will just show up at 08:00 a.m. On Thursday morning. Okay, great. Thank you so much, all. Not a problem, Rebecca. You have a great day. You too. Bye.

Your call is very important to us. Please stay on the line and we will be right with you. Blenden Sons, this is Marianne. How may I help you? Hi. I need to talk to somebody who knows anything about the automatic humidifier control that we had installed in our house. There's a few issues and I want to know what I need to do or if somebody needs to come out here because it's going to end up flooding our basement. The humidifier is flooding your basement, is that correct? The drain for it. First off, the water won't even shut off and it's flashing. Change water panels. I don't know what that means, but the water won't shut off. And the tube that they had to catch the water to feed it to the sewer drain in the basement, it's not secured at all. So they put it on like two little blocks and it slipped off the block. So there was water running all through our basement because the water won't shut off to it and the tube wasn't secured. Okay. Let me go ahead and ask someone to call you back on that. One moment, please. Okay. Let's see what it is. Is this going to be like I'm going to ask someone in the office to call you there until seven this evening. I'm just assisting them with their lines. May I get your name? My name is Grace. Grace. Grace. And last name? My last name is Metler. Mettler. And what number would they call you back on Ms. Metler? 910-964-4219 thank you. I'll repeat. 910-964-4219 and what is your address, please? Three. 3220 5th Street Northwest Canton, Ohio. Four. Four. Was that 590909? And you said, Canton, I got it. Yes. All right. So I'm going to send this over to the office. You said you don't necessarily need someone to come out tonight, but you want them to call you. Is that correct? They need to come out or they need to tell me what to do so it doesn't keep flooding our basement. I feel like it's an urgent thing. Okay. So I'm going to send this over. Ms. Grace, ask him to call you at 910-964-4219 As I mentioned, they are until seven, so someone should reach out to you. All right. All right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye. Bye.

That's Tuesday the fourth, if you're available. Let me see if I would have a set time. Would you be available tomorrow? No, Mondays and Fridays would work really well for me. Okay. Yeah. Well, Friday the 7th. I could get someone out there around 830. Yeah, that would work. Okay. All right. Now, there is a service call fee of 120 to get them out to the home and then any work done would be additional. We've been a long term customer, and usually they're willing to waive that for us with the cost of work. Would you be willing to do that? So I can't waive it entirely, but I could have it cut in half if you move forward with any work. Okay, that would be fine. Okay. All right, perfect. So then I have you set here. We said that was Friday, April 7, 830, and we'll send John out there for you. Okay, thank you. You're very welcome. Is this the best number to reach you? The one you're calling from? Yes, this is my cell phone. Okay. All right. I have you all set here for Friday. We'll see you Friday morning. All right, thanks. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye

I work from home, and I just blew a fuse when I tried to plug in a little heater under my desk, and I went to reset the breaker and nothing's happening. I unplugged everything on that whole side of the house and I even tried the main breaker to reset that, and nothing's happening. I can't get my lights or electric back on on this side of the house, so I have a feeling it might need replaced, and I don't know how to do that. And I'm kind of afraid to try to YouTube it because it looks like it should be dangerous. Are you guys sure? No, absolutely, we are. Yes, we do. We do replace breakers. I can try to get someone out. Yeah, I could try to get someone out for you still today. I just couldn't guarantee it. We could try our best. Okay. Can I set up an appointment? How much would you charge for that? I guess let's start there. If they would need to replace the breaker, so I don't know what the work itself would run. We do have a service call fee to get out to the home of 120, and then they would put up the work for you on flight. So just to come out, it's 120? That's right. And then whatever work they do is added on top of that? That's correct. We don't charge anything by the hour. It's just by the job itself. But, yeah, they would provide the essence once they get out there. Do you mind if I make a couple of other phone calls and I may call you guys back? Okay. Absolutely. If you decide to move forward, give us a call. Yeah. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. Take care. Thank you. Bye.

If you get somebody out here today, that'd be super. Okay. And then real quick, the number that you called in from, is that still the best to reach you? Yes. Okay. And I do apologize, sir. I had given you the wrong price a second ago. I didn't realize that that maintenance plan you had did expire. So I do apologize. The diagnostic is, however, like I said, if it is anything warranty related, from there, they would go ahead and adjust that. Okay. Wow. My warranty is. Okay, they're expired. It'll be two years old in a couple of days. Dollar call. Guy might just have to relight the pilot light or something. I don't know. Don't you think that's a little outrageous? I know you don't make the rules. I'm 70 years old. I'm a senior citizen trying to live on a month, which is hard. I really think if this thing was years old, I could see this thing's not even two years old. Dollars. Yes. So that is our diagnostic fee. However, if it is something warrant related, from there, they would go ahead and adjust that. Wow. Dollars. Okay. I have to think about it. I'll call you back, okay? Okay. No worries. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye now. Bye. Oh, you know what, ma'am?

This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please, please disconnect at this time. Thank you for calling blending suns. This is Heather. How can I help you? Hello. We got a new furnace and air conditioner last November, December. And they couldn't do the final check of the air conditioning. So I wanted to schedule that because it was too cold at the. Oh, let me see here. And is this for the Robert Eisenhow? Okay, I'm so did. So we did the install and they were unable to do what now? I'm sorry. They said that they checked the furnace all out and they installed the air conditioner, but they said that the final check of it or something couldn't be done till the weather was warmer. Okay, let me check on that 1 second for me, Kathy. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay. I am so sorry. Kathy, are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay, so normally after an install, we would say for you to go ahead and just turn the air conditioner on when needed. And then obviously, if you had any issues, definitely just let us know and we have a visit that we will owe you for maintenance on the air conditioner. But we'd like to wait until the unit has ran for a season. So definitely go ahead, turn it on. And if you find anything isn't working properly, definitely give us a call, let us know and we'll get them out right away for you. Okay. And you do have it that on that service contract we had bought, which is when they checked the furnace last fall and said, oops, you have a problem. We still have the one check left on that then, for the air conditioning? Yes, ma'am. Air conditioning check. And another furnace check we still owe you as well. Okay. So the best thing then is when it gets hot enough, run the air conditioner and then see if we need servicing. And if we don't, would it extend till the next season? They have an expiration date, I guess. No. So the unit isn't a year old yet. So just if you find there's an issue within that first year, we would come out as a possible callback. There wouldn't be like a charge or anything. And then they would just find out what's going on for you. And then the maintenance visit we would hold on to till next season. Okay. So we're talking next spring. Okay. Yes. Okay, well, that clears it all up. And I'm just as happy to turn it on and hope everything works. Good. Yes. Because that's how we got involved in the whole buying thing. Once they came out and they told us some of the same things they had said the year before, except those parts had gotten worse, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah. Okay. Well, that clears it up, then. Thank you. Not a problem. You have a good one. Thank you. Bye bye. Goodbye.

I'm a client of yours, and I needed to see about maybe scheduling some service for hydroelectric boiler and some expansion tanks at my residence. Okay. Is it maintenances that you need? One is repair. I have a hydroelectronic boiler, like a floor radiant heater for our sunroom. That one's not working properly. The circulating pump is not. Okay. Something's not right. Okay, what's the address for that one? Yeah. Two five one melody drive. M-E-L-O-D-Y. Okay. And this is Jason that I'm speaking with? Yes, correct. Okay, Jason. And then let me look at something here. All right. Phone number I have for you is 330-814-7874 correct. Okay. What's your preferred email address? Jason? Legal 77 at@gmail.com you might have said a toothpaste. I was assuming you probably have. No, I got it. Yes. Thank you. All right. Now to send the technician over. Well, you said it's a boiler, right? But it's not heating. Well, it's an electric boiler. Yeah. And once we had all these power outages, when it tried to come back on, when I tried to fire it back up, it doesn't seem to be kicking on and off, on and off. So I think it's something with a circulating pump or could be something, but it's an electronic electric boiler. Okay. So to send the technician over there is a diagnostic of 150. We do have availability today or the rest of this week. Okay. And does that 150 come off if I have them repaired or how does that work? Any repairs or upgrades would be on top of the 150. Okay, got you. And then do you guys do any bundle deals? Because I also have them. I want them to check. So that's one business. We run a business out of our house. So that's one thing which I need. Build invoice separately or paid separately. Okay. And then I also need him. Same technician, probably while he's there looking at our main house kind of heating boiler system. Heating system. Just kind of more of a checkup kind of tune up. Check the expansion tanks and see how it's running. See if there's. Everything's good with the boiler. So that one's all a boiler system. It's a boiler furnace. Boiler heating system. So it's not unique, but it's just kind of more specialized, I guess, for each. Right, okay. Yeah. So the tune ups would be for the boilers. They are $129. No, I'm sorry. We're running a special for 59. So is the other address you're speaking of four. 40 Everest Avenue? No, you can remove that one. No, same address. It's two five one melody. Oh, same address, same house. Okay, got you. All right, and you have just one system at two five one melody? Yeah. It's got a main boiler and then a hot water tank, and then it's got an upstairs and downstairs furnace, the split level. Okay. So with the boiler, it'd be $150, to quote any repairs or upgrades, and then the tune ups would be $59 per unit. Okay. Yes. You said originally the boiler was $59. Yeah, for the tune up, but if it's not running properly. Oh, it's running. Okay, then it would be $59 per unit. Yes. Let me just say it again, because there's two separate things going on. One wing of our house runs the sunroom, runs that electronic boiler system. It's separate. There's two boilers. Let me put it that way. There's one electronic boiler that's small unit. It's probably, like, a 220 volts, wall mounted small unit just runs a 500 square foot sunroom. That's it. So that's the one that's not working at all. Okay, so then that one, when it's not the one that's not working at all, is going to be the $150 diagnostic charge we got to do to repair it, which, on top of that. I get that. So that's good. Right? And then any maintenance would be $59 per unit. Okay. Yeah. And then the other units, which. The main house has those other boilers, so everything's running properly on the main house. It's just, I want to tune up and checked out. And maybe the expansion tanks, those might need replaced. I'm not sure. Okay. Or this week, I would have Wednesday, April 5 in the afternoon, the 6th or the 7th. It would be between one and six, and we'd call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay, and what time Wednesday? Wednesday would be between one and six, with a call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Okay, got you. Yeah, that's fine. We can do Wednesday, April 5. Okay. And then let me make some notes here. Do you know how old the systems are, by chance? I don't, unfortunately. Okay, not a problem. No clue. We bought the house in 2020, and they look pretty new. The one boiler that's not working looks more old, I guess. More dated. Okay. Just going to make some notes here, so bear with me. Yeah, sure. Thank you. So the mat will be 59 for the maintenance. Okay, so I've got everything noted here. I've got you on for Wednesday, April 5, between one and six, and then we will call 15 to 30 minutes prior to arrival. Perfect. Okay. Anything else I could help you with, too, Holly? Well, I just want to make sure that they're built separately. So, like, the one unit, the boiler that's not working, but that's coming out of our business account, I want to make sure there's two separate invoices whenever the job's complete. Okay, I've got that noted as well. Okay, perfect. All right, well, very good. So we'll see you sometime April 5 in the afternoon. You got it. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Jason. Have a good day. You, too. Thanks. Bye. I think.

So we have a breaker that is tripping and we can't get it to restore power to a certain area of the house. So I'm not sure exactly what the issue is. Okay. Yeah. So the way we work is to get our electrician to the home. We do have a service call fee of 120. And then they would give the pricing from there once they figure out what's going on with the issue. Okay. All right. And we have availability this afternoon or tomorrow? Okay. Yeah. What time this afternoon would you be available? Yeah. So our technicians are routed on location. So it would just be sometime after twelve here. But we would give a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes prior. Okay. All right. And what is the name you would like on the account? It's Robert Williams. All right. And the address is 2119 7th as in the number seven. Okay, perfect. And the number you called in from, is that the best number to reach you when we're on the way? Yes, ma'am, it is. All right. And the last thing, is there an email that you'd like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? Sure. The email is Robert. R-O-B-E-R-T. John, J-O-H-N. Williams. williams@gmail.com. Okay, perfect. I went ahead and got that added for you. And I can go ahead and get this put through for today. And as soon as that electrician becomes available, we will give you a call and let you know. Okay, great. Sounds good. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks. Have a good one. All right, you, too. Bye.

Hi, I called earlier this morning. I've got an issue with no heat and they were going to try to get somebody out. They said between like ten and eleven and it's 1130 now. But I was just wondering possibly the status. I've got to go to work and my wife's got some running around to do. I do apologize. This is John at North Allen Road. Yes, okay. I do apologize for any miscommunication. They told you it would be before eleven. Well, she said ten or eleven, something like that. She said they were doing inventory or something. Yes, I believe she was meaning to tell you it'd be sometime after ten or eleven is most likely when we would give you a phone call. Right now it does not look like we have anybody freed up to send over to you yet. So we were still looking at a little bit later. Okay, can I ask. And I know you guys are busy. I know there's a million things going on. Could I schedule something for like tomorrow morning or is that kind of all booked? So our mornings get taken up pretty quickly. Right now I don't have any mornings available. Really? Every day that we would be looking at, it would most likely be sometime after like 09:10 a.m. That we would call you. Okay. I'm just trying to think here. We usually call about 30 minutes before they're ready to head over. So what we could do is after we give you that call, we could always meet you at the home, if that helps at all. Okay. Yeah, I'm just trying to figure this out a little bit. It sucks. I'm sorry, sir. I know it's kind of hard. It's okay. I'm just trying to think this through. So, do you know, is it going to be like afternoon probably right now? Today? Yes, it's most likely going to be afternoon sometime. Probably after one at this point is what we would be looking at. Okay. Hmm. Trying to think what my best I might tell her to just try to go do her thing now and see if she can then meet the technician later. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, we have the three, three oh 380. Is there another number you'd like us to have as a backup or anything? Let me give you her number also that. 1330-388-7075 Perfect. And her name? Sharon. I'm so sorry. Did you say Taryn with a t or Karen with A-K-S? Sharon. S. Sharon. Sorry, I got it totally wrong. No problem. All right, I've got Sharon's number on there, so we'll definitely try both of those numbers if we need to as soon as we have our technician ready again. We usually call anywhere between, like, 30 minutes to sometimes even an hour, depending on where they're at, before they're ready to head over. So we can always meet you at the home after we give the call. Okay? That would be great. Yeah. Okay. That's all we can kind of do for now without having any heat. It's nice. It's kind of warming up outside today, but, yeah, at night it gets pretty cold and just not have any heat at all. Little bit of a pain in the butt, I bet. I can't. You know, we'll keep you on for today, and we'll give you guys a call as soon as we can. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Thank you, John. You have a good one, sir. Okay, bye.

Hi, my name is Michael Troutman. I'm a realtor with remax diversity over in Talmudge. I just had an inspection on a house. We have a house under contract, and the inspector recommended an electrician to come out. And I don't know if you guys have worked with many realtors, but in the contract it states that we have five days to get all of the inspections done, and our last day is tomorrow. And so I don't know if there's any way I can get someone to come out today or tomorrow morning. Okay. I know there's a ton of power outage outages and everyone's busy right now. Yeah, I mean, we could try to get someone out there for you. I would say we would need to schedule with the current homeowner. We always need their permission before sending anyone to the home. I would have to get in touch with because they're selling the home through a business. So it's not just a single person. That way? Yeah. Hmm. I'm not sure how that would work. Let me find out for you. Can I place on a brief hold? Yeah, just whoever you're talking to, let them know that there's a contract stating that we're able to bring in anyone within five days. So, like, there's contract backup for you guys and everything. Oh, perfect. Okay. One moment, please. Awesome. Thank you the lam you. Thank you for holding. Sir, are you still there? Yes. Okay. All right. So I do apologize. Yeah, it looks like we will need to speak with the homeowner. I'm sorry. No, you're okay. No worries. Thank you. You guys have a good one. Bye.

Yes, I live in Wadsworth and I think I need a plumber out here. Okay. Yeah. And have we been to your home before? No. Okay, and what's going on at the home? Okay, well, it's a kitchen sink. I was using the garbage disposal. I think I put too much junk in it. And I don't think it's the garbage disposal. It got all clogged up. I got like a double sink. So my husband took the pipes and the PVC pipes underneath at a park to unclog it and he can't get it back together. Got you. Okay. Yeah, he's got kind of like memory problems and I think that's probably it. But anyway. Yeah, we finally are calling crying uncle. We need help. Got you. Yeah, we could definitely try to get a technician over today for you. And the way that we work is we do have a service cost fee of 120 that gets them to the home to look over everything and then give the pricing from there. Okay, so it's 120 and that's before they do anything. Yeah. So the 120 gets our technician to the home and to diagnose the issue and then give the pricing and then they'll fix it right there. Yeah. They do have fully stocked vehicles, so as long as it's something they have on their truck, they are able to help. Same day we try to. Yeah. Okay. And then for today, they are routed on location. So I would just have an arrival after twelve here most likely, but we would give a call when we're on the way, 15 to 30 minutes prior. Okay. Around. It'll be after twelve. And then you'll call about 20 minutes. You said before. Is that what you said? Okay. All right, so you need an address now, don't you? Yeah. And what's the name that you would like on your account? Well, Diana. D-I-A-N-A. Cooper. C-O-O-P-E-R. Okay, and what is the address? It's 10 00:50 Nelson Court. N-E-L-S-O-N. Nelson court. Okay, perfect. And the number you called in from, is that the best number to reach you when we're on the way? I'm going to give you another one. I mean, it's probably okay, but 330-30-9396 if you got room for both numbers, go ahead and you can have both numbers. I'm sorry, what? Okay. No, you're fine. The one you just gave me, is that a home or a cell phone? That's a cell. And then the one I'm calling on is home. Perfect. All right, I just want to make sure. And then the last thing is, do you have an email that you'd like on file for any receipts? Sure. It's D-I-A-N-A-D-U-L-A-N-E-Y. Okay, perfect. Diane, I went ahead and got that added for you, and I will go ahead and get this put through for today, and as soon as that plumber becomes available, we will give you a call and let you know. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks. Have a great day. You, too. Bye.

My name is Tobias McAfe, and I have a furnace tune up set up for later this April. On Saturday. I just had one canceled due to some. I guess you guys had a tech call off. I originally set up for just Saturday appointments, but I have availability through the week and I want to see if we could push that date up a little bit. Okay. Tobias, is this for Fairway Avenue? That is correct. Okay. All right, let's take a peek here. I forgot what the date was for my next appointment. I think it was the 20th. Okay. 18th or something like that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I see that we are on for Saturday, the 29th. Does that sounds right? Sounds about right, yes. Okay. And you said you're available sooner? I am. Because due to my work schedule earlier, it's changed. I was only available on Saturday, but now you have availability. I see. Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, I could get this moved up as early as Thursday of this week. We can look out further into the month if you'd like. Now, I will say right now for the month of April. I don't have many set times left. Maybe a time window, either between nine and one or one and six. Nine and one is cool. Okay. And you want to do that Thursday the 6th? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to get this moved over to Thursday, April 6, between nine to one. And then we'll give that call ahead when we're on our way. Sounds good.

This is Kathy Carter. And they sent me a message saying that I needed to make an appointment for my air conditioner to be checked. I have. I don't know what you call it.

Correct. I apologize. That's why I had to think about that because I'm just. Yep, I do it all the time. Me too. Yes. So let's get you scheduled for the AC maintenance. Kathy, when would you like to get it done? I can get you scheduled for April or May. When would you like. What do you have in? If I could do pretty much any day in April. The only thing is all of our specific time slots have gotten taken up for the whole month of April already. They filled up really quickly, so I only have time frames available for this month. Okay, specific. Okay, explain what the difference between specific and time frames. Because if somebody's going worked on at 10:00 then I can't be scheduled at ten. I can be scheduled from eleven to one. Unless somebody is specifically scheduled at twelve. So how do you do that? So, yeah, we have either between nine and one or one and six time frame. Or if we looked into May, I could find you more of a specific time. Like an 08:00 a.m. Or a 10:00 a.m. Or 1230 or 230 are usually the times that we give. We're looking the last two weeks of May because I am going to be out of state until the 17th, possibly later because I'm flying home standby. So I'm not guaranteed on being home by the 18th. I'm only maybe going home schedule starting the week of the 22nd. And then I'm running into at the end of school, which is. That's good, because then I'm running into the other person that helps me out with all the stuff that goes on here is going to be in Texas starting the 22 may, maybe. Okay. Yeah, you will. He's gone every two weeks. Let's look at. What do you have available then? Yeah, I mean, I have availability pretty much that whole week. Do you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment? Actually sounds terrible. I do middle of the day better than I do because I am getting kids. And with him gone, I've got to get kids out and one of them to school, and then I've got to get one of them. I have helped the other grandparents help pick the child up from school. Not every day, but some days. So there's get one of them to pick her up for me. Okay. So that gives me a little. I could do that Monday the 22nd, around 1230. Okay. That probably will work. That gives me enough time to give everybody involved in Oxford chance to have my granddaughter stay with me. Her and her husband are. They're having a hard time finding someplace to live a lot for the time being since I've got the space. Yeah. Well, that's very kind of you. And they have my great grandson, and there's no way I'm letting him be someplace. Yes. I have nine granddaughters, four daughters, nine granddaughters. And I have no boys. And she's 26. And I got a great grandson. Oh, wow. That's exciting. Congrats. Thanks. I have to let everybody know and make sure that they're aware that the 22nd. That we're going to have people invading the house. Yes, ma'am. We will have you down here for the 22nd. 22nd at 1230. You got it. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes, not a problem.

That work better for you than others since they're pretty much on there a lot of the times. Probably any day as long as a couple of them in check on from time to time. I work from home, so I'm usually here. Got you. Now, April is pretty booked up, but we do have some open between nine and one. Or we could go into May. When is the nine and one? You said we could do that starting end day next week so that we get. Okay. Any of those days would work. Okay. I don't have morning meetings. Okay. We could do Monday, April 10. That would work. Okay. And then we'd call minutes prior to arrival. Okay. And would you like us to call the home or the cell? Go ahead and call the home. That way I'm sure to hear it. The home. Okay. Sometimes. The other thing is, I had a problem with my furnace this year where the board died, and they were telling me that something about a surge protector. Okay. Protect. How much does that cost, do you know? I don't even know what it is. I don't. Yeah. I don't have the price for that. But when the technician comes out on Monday, I can note it here and then he can quote that for you. Yeah. And that would not be Hvac. It'd be electrical. Right, so it'd be a different technician. No, it would be h. Yeah, it would be electrical. I thought you were talking about for the furnace. Oh, is there one just for the furnace? I didn't know. I heard them talk about it. Okay, I'll ask the HVAC person. He'll know, and I'll just put it in the notes. Yeah. My family, there's four in the local area. All four of us had our furnaces die this year, and I think three of them were the board. I'm like, I don't think I want to go through that again. Right. Yeah, absolutely. Understandable. And I'll put that in the notes here. So I've got you on. And renew with the technician for the Susan, Monday, April 10 between nine and one. Sounds great. Thank you very much. Okay. You're welcome. Thank you. You have a wonderful day. You too. Bye. Thank you. Bye.

Is that something I can get from you guys? You want to know what kind of panel it's going to be? Yeah. Because right now there's a square d panel in there and all the breakers, obviously.

So you're supposed to be getting a panel change with the generator? Yeah, there's supposed to be a panel change and a whole house surge protector going in. And the panel change is actually replacing two boxes in there. Two panels. And the reason I'm kind of concerned is, number one, I don't know how many breakers, positions it's going to have in it. Number two, if it's not a square d, are you guys actually giving me a new surge protector breaker for the hot tub and that kind of stuff? Just trying to plan ahead. Sure. Yeah.

The first one was pretty awful, but the second one, there seems to be a lot more trees down on people. I saw a tree on a car and somebody was in it. There was a pine tree. It fell across the road and I could see headlights. So somebody was just driving down the road. And hopefully they're okay. But it was a big pine tree. Pine tree.

I believe you guys handle my generac service on my generator. But I'm calling on behalf of a customer. So they're out of town, but I know their generator is out. Can you look up their address and see if they are a customer? Sure. What's the address? Silverview. It's one word, Silverview. And that is Silver Lake. That's actually a stowe mailing address, but it'Silver Lake under Bob. And yes, they are a customer of ours. Okay. Mr. Handelman had passed away a year ago, so I know that it hasn't been serviced. And we had a power outage over the weekend. She's out of town, but they notified me and I went over and checked. It looks like the battery is dead. It probably hadn't been serviced in several years. So I need to set that up again. They're out of town, so it's not an emergency that they get over there. But I need to set it up for, I guess, service and possibly battery or whatever it needs to get it running again. Okay, sure. So to send the electrician over, there is a service call fee and then any kind of repairs, upgrades or maintenance. He would quote that when he's out there, that's fine. And then we've got availability as early as today or the rest of this week. What do you have today? Today I wouldn't have an exact time. They're all in the field as we speak.

And then as far as payment, I can give them a credit card, right? Right. Check, cash or credit card? You probably don't bill them, I wouldn't think. And again, she's out of town, but I do have a credit card for this account to handle it, so that's fine. Okay. All right, perfect. I will get everything noted here.

And is this for Maplewood street in Chaga Falls? You're good. Thank you. Yeah. So we would need to come out there and provide an estimate for you on site, would you say? It would just be a couple of feet. Then as far as the cold air return goes, it's probably about 20ft. Okay. Yeah. Because the cold air return that's in here now was from when it was originally built as a coal fired or a gravity fed furnace. And it's huge. Keep whacking my head on the damn thing.

I need an estimate on getting some ductwork replaced and or modified. And the nice person transferred me to you. Okay. What I have. I have an old air return that's inordinately huge. And when I say huge, I whack my head on it when I walk over there. Okay. Granted, this is not a real tall built in basement, but this thing was put in probably when it was a gravity fed furnace and not a forest air. And it's got a hole in it and some other stuff. And I just kind of like to get it replaced. It's about 20ft long. Okay. And I'd also like to have a vent put in one of the ducts so that it heats the basement a bit. And so those two things. Okay. All right. So normally the install manager, he would come out and take a look at that for you. His name is Kenny. Give me one moment here. He said it's about a 20 foot long run. Yeah, roughly. Might be a little bit more, might be a little bit less, but close. And add a register. Add a vent. Yeah. Okay. All right. And you are still at 26 Eightywood street in Cuyahoga Falls? Yeah. Okay.

I can't guarantee that there's going to be someone here during the day on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, but I'm always here on Monday and Friday. Okay. All right.

Can you see on your records how many times he's been here? Or how many times a plumber has been here for the same issue? Yeah. Let me look here. It looks like he was there once for the leak in the shower, and then the second time was for the toilet in the home. And then the third time, the original time, was the leak through the ceiling.

And then to get him over, we do have a service call fee of 120 that gets him to the home to look over the issue and then give any estimates from there or any repair price. Oh, they don't even fix it that day. Yeah, so they do have fully stocked vehicles. It does really depend on if they need to order any part they may not have. It really just depends as well as how long the job would take. But they may try to, depending on the extent of the workbook. Okay, well, I'll set up the appointment right now unless I can find someone to come out immediately today. Okay, yeah, absolutely. And what is the name you would like on the account? Mary. Okay.

This call is being recorded. If you do not wish to be recorded, please disconnect at this time. Thank you for calling blind and sons. This is Katen, how can I help you? Yes, I wanted to see if I could schedule actually a service as well as a quote for my AC system. Okay. Yeah. And were you looking to replace that whole unit? Yeah, my air conditioning unit needs replaced, so I want to get a quote on that. While they're quoting that, I would like them to take a look at the whole system per se. Got you. Okay. Thirdly, I'm sorry, I got a new washer, and the connector to the cold water is so corroded that I can't turn it off to replace the. The connection. So I need an actual plumbing call as well. Got you. Okay. Yeah, that's definitely something we can help with. And then do you know off the top of your head how old your furnace is as well? I'm guessing probably 1520 years. Okay. Yeah, I just know that we are running a special for the new units. When you buy a furnace for us, you actually get half off the AC with ten year parts and labor warranty. So that's why I was just wondering. I wasn't sure if you were interested in replacing both. Well, here's what I would like. First of all, I need my connector to my washer replaced water connection. But I was hoping while somebody's doing that, they could look at my whole system and give me a quote, like to say, yeah, the AC needs done for sure. And like I said, I have your coupon for the 50% off kind of thing. So I want to see what you guys think. Got you. Okay. Yeah. So what I would recommend, since you aren't exactly 100% sure if you do want to replace yet, so we could still always get a plumber out to the home. That's no problem. And then I would maybe recommend doing a $59 tune up that we offer on the AC. And they kind of just look over all the moving parts of the unit and see what kind of shape they are in. And then from there, if you do decide to go get that new unit, they would send out, we call them a comfort consultant. They would come to the home and then give all the pricing for the new unit from there. Or if you know that you're leaning towards replacement, we could always just go through with the free estimate. It is completely up to you. But it would be two different technicians regardless. Okay. Yeah, I need the whole system looked at. The AC is original, and I don't know when these places were built, but definitely need to look at it. So I would like to schedule, please, and then schedule a time for someone to come and look at the system and provide a quote for either the AC or everything. Okay, sounds good. So what we'll do here is I'll go ahead and make the. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. So if someone's coming out to work on that washer connection, would that same person be able to do the $59 ac look at. It would be two separate technicians. It would be a service tech and then a plumber. Okay. Yeah, let's just do the plumber for now and then get somebody scheduled to quote the system. Okay, sounds good. So what we'll do here is I'll go and take your information and schedule the plumber side of it. I actually can't schedule the comfort consultant, but I will transfer you over to my coworker. Diane is her name, and she'll be able to get you scheduled for that part. Okay. All right. And what is the name you would like on the account? My name is Scott Swartz. S-W-A-R-T-Z. Okay. And then I don't have any plumbers available tomorrow. We actually do not work on Sundays. Yeah, I meant Monday. Okay, sounds good. I just want to make sure. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been traveling all week, so I'm just home and I don't know what day it is. Would be great, because I am home on Monday. Okay, and what's the address for me? Seven two two Hampton Ridge drive. It's three words. It's in the. Up on Smith Hill. Okay, and what city is that located in Akron? 44313. Perfect. Okay. And then the number you called in from Scott, is that the best number to reach you when we're on the way? Yeah, 8849. Yes. Okay. And then is there an email that you'd like to keep on file for any receipts or estimates? My. I guess, yeah, my email is C-O-T-T. Ed Swartz. swartz@gmail.com. Okay, perfect. I went ahead and got that added for you. And then to get our plumber to the home, we do have a service call fee of 120, and then they would give the pricing from there. But since you are looking also in other departments, what I'll do for you, since you are a first time customer as well, I'll waive that if you go with their quoted repair. Okay, well, you mean the replacement of the HVAC system? I mean for the plumber with the valve. So if you go with the quote that they give at the home, I can go ahead and waive that service call fee for you. Yeah, I need that repaired. So. Absolutely. That would be fantastic. I appreciate that. Yeah, absolutely. And on Monday. Here, let me look and see. I actually have a call available. It would be between twelve and one after their inventory in the afternoon. Can we do more like 02:00? Yeah, absolutely. So I would just put in, if not, you would be under what we call our next available technician since they have inventory. Most likely would be after two anyway. But we'll give you a call when he's on the way, then 15 to 30 minutes prior. Fantastic. Thank you very much. Yeah, absolutely. Well, you are all set on my end, Scott, and I will get you transferred over to my coworker. Okay, thank you. Have a great rest of the weekend. You too. Thank you. Hi, this is Diane with Blendan Sons. I am sorry I missed your call. I'm either on the other line or I'm away from my desk. Please leave me a message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thank you. Hello, my name is Scott Sports Swartz. I just put a service call in with you folks for a plumbing issue, but I wanted to was then transferred to you. I would like to schedule a time to have someone come out and quote, I know my air conditioner system is in need of replacement and want to look at the whole house system while we're in that process. My phone number is 330-414-8849 again, my name is Scott Schwartz. I'm at 722 Hampton Ridge Drive, Akron, Ohio. Thank you very much, bye.

My husband and I just bought a house out in Akron, and I just had a couple of questions, if you don't mind. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. So we have two toilets that are just loose, so I think the wax ring around it just needs to be fixed. And I'm assuming you guys can do that. Big one that I was curious about is we're looking to kind of take out our tub and replace it with a walk in shower. Is that something that you guys could help with or no? Yeah, so we do install new showers. I know that is something we should be able to do. Okay. And then the gas guy came out the other day and turned the gas on and the water heater, like the pilot light just wouldn't get all the way up to actually turn on. Is that something that you guys could potentially help with too, or no? Yes, we can. Excellent. And then I saw on the site that you don't really want to give ballparks about cost estimates and everything. I'm assuming it's just going to be cost of labor and the cost of the actual parts and then how difficult the job is and complexity. But I do want to ask, do you have a general, the first hour generally cost about this much for labor and then everything else costs this much or no. So we don't have any pricing over the phone, but we do not actually charge anything by the hour. It is by the job itself. So to get our technician over, the way we work is we do have a service call fee of 120 that gets them to the home to look over every problem. And they do kind of a general look over of the plumbing at the home in general. And then they would give the upfront pricing for the job itself once they know what's going on at the home. Okay, awesome. Well, thank you so much. I'm going to talk to my husband. We're trying to figure out what all to do. So we have a lot to figure out, but I just wanted to get a little bit of information. So I very much appreciate your time. Thank you so much. Yeah, thanks. Have a great day. You too. Bye.

You can definitely do that. Unfortunately, we don't put that towards major equipment, though. It can be used on any work that might be done at the home. So if they ever have any plumbing work or electrical work or any work done on the system, they can use it towards that. You can. And they can but any major equipment, unfortunately, it doesn't go towards. I wish it did, though. Okay. And then my last question is there, as far as to pay for it in cash versus financing, is there an incentive to pay cash versus financing? I don't believe so. I'm not 100% on that answer. So whoever their consultant was, the guy that gave them the estimate, he would actually be the best for these questions, because they set up everything. Do they know who their consultant was? Yeah, and my son will probably be calling. He doesn't know I called. I was just calling about the MVP thing because we thought. Oh, yeah, definitely that. Mom. No. Yeah. You know, so happy with you. Good. So many different companies out there and a lot of choices. Like, you guys were there when we needed you, so sometimes that doesn't always happen. So I'm sure my son will take care of it and contact his person. Sure. Heather, thank you very much for the information. Yeah, not a problem at all. Thank you for everything and sticking with us. And if you need anything else, just let us. Yeah, if you need anything else, just let us know. But definitely tell him to call his consultant. He'll be the best for help with these questions. Okay. Okay. And if for some reason, he does decide to go with you guys and we refer him, he said that there's a potential that we would greet the benefit. Yes, ma'am. Yes. If he goes with it, let definitely make sure that his consultant knows that, and he can make sure that he gets that applied to your guys'account for you. Okay, great. Well, thank you so much. You have a good evening and rest of your week. You too. Take care. Yes. Thank you, ma'am. You too. Bye.

You probably have. My husband is 330-204-7265 you can keep that as primary. Okay, sounds good. And then to get an electrician over, we do have a service call fee of 120 that would get them to the home to access situation, and then they would give the pricing from there once they figure out what's going on. Does the 120 go towards the service if we move forward? Yeah. So it normally is separate, but what I can do for you is I can go ahead and waive that if you go with the quoted repair. Okay. All right.

Do you have any sort of pricing guide as to know what an exterior plug is or. No, I do not. But we don't charge anything by the hour. It is by the job itself.

Because half of the house had power. Half of it didn't, if that makes any sense. Yeah. So, like one side of it has gone bad. So the fee to come out would be 120.

Yeah, I got a hot water tank here at my house that has a bad sensor. And the guy that just left said since it's so old, which I don't think it's like seven years old, it's going to be days before they can get the part, or a week. And then they wanted like three grand to change the hot water tank, which to me seems outrageous. So I don't know what you guys do. Yeah. So the way that we work is to get our technician over. We do have a service cost fee of a 120 that gets them to the home to look over in the situation. And then they would give the pricing for the repair from there. And the first we have, we are looking at Monday. Can somebody give me a quote to just put a new one in? Yeah. So for that, we still would have to send a technician out. It would be a free estimate if you did want to go that route, but we would still be looking at Monday. Yeah. I got to start pricing this out. I told this guy, I'm not just taking his word for it, that it's $3,000. I think this thing was $650 when I bought it. It just seems crazy that it's that much more expensive. Got you. Okay. Yeah.

This is Caitlin, how can I help you? Hi, I've been a fairly frequent customer for the past few years because I have my house and my rental house that you guys have taken care of for me. Anyway, we just got a new furnace and air conditioner last year and we already have our date set for them to come and do the annual checkup on it to keep the warranty going on it. Right. So anyway, that's scheduled I think in June or something. But anyway, we have another issue at the house. At our house, not the septic car, but just the well system. We have no water pressure. The water pressure has been getting worse and worse over the years and now it's just so slow. We got no pressure in the shower and I'm sure it's the expansion pressure tank thing or whatever, but it may be that the water softener that all might be gunked up. And so what we'd like is a quote or whatever to have that replaced or tuned up or whatever. You know what I mean? It may be salvageable, I don't know. Got you. Okay. Is this for 4948 Edge Park Drive? No, it's for the other 118105 harvest drive. Oh, got you. Okay. Yeah. You guys did a great job at Edge park on my boiler there. I was very pleased. You guys are very timely, everything. And you did such a great job on our house here. I've been touting you to everybody I know. They coblind and stuff. Oh, gotcha. We love to have good feedback. Yeah. Let me go ahead and look here. Give me just 1 second please. Sure. Okay. Give me just one moment. It. It. Okay. I apologize for that. Hold there, sir. Unfortunately we actually do not travel that far for our plumbers or electricians. We do for our heating and cooling side, but they just don't travel as far. I see. Do you have someone in the area that would come here that you would suggest? Yeah, I don't know. Off of the top of my head anyone, when we are able to help, we do recommend angie.com. They have a lot of recommendations based off your area. Right. Because usually I do work myself and everything, but how often does it come up that I do the water software? Never. You know what I mean? And I don't know what's appropriate got you these days. But then again, it's a matter of trust. I trust you guys. I don't really know who I could trust elsewhere as far as giving me a good deal, you know what I mean? Because I've had quotes, and you guys far surpass other guys that I've quoted that were in this area. You know what I mean? And that's why we went with you for the furnace and stuff. That's why I use you at my edge park house, because I know you're pretty good. But that puts me in a pickle, kind of. There's nobody you really know of? Not off the top of my head, unfortunately. Okay. Well, thank you then. Yeah, thank you for trying. And I hope you find someone. And you have a good day. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye.

The house fan works, and it shows that it's cooling when I put it on the cool setting.

Our air is not working for some reason and need to see if somebody can come out. Take a look. Got you. Okay. And have we been to the home before? Yes. Okay. And what is the address, please? It's 3890 Wood Glen Avenue. And that is in Norton, Ohio, 4420. $3. Got you. Okay. Yeah, so I apologize. I'm not showing that in our system. We did switch systems, however, so it may just not have transferred over. But the first we have for a technician, we are looking at Tuesday as our soonest. Oh, wow. Yeah, that probably is not going to work. Okay, well, I will call you back if needed. All right, well, thank you. All right, thanks. Bye.
