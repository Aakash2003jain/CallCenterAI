# Call Center Audio Multi-Class Classification

This repository contains the code for a multi-class classification model designed to categorize call center audio data into different classes. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and the Transformers library.

## Description

In this project, we develop a machine learning model capable of classifying call center audio recordings into predefined categories. The model is built using a BERT-based architecture for handling textual data extracted from audio, and it is trained and fine-tuned for optimal performance.
